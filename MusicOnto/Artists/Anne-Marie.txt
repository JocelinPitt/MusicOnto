Song title: 2002

[Verse 1]
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
Uh, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
[Verse 2]
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love, love, love63EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1]
You lay here with me, you're shuttin' down

I saw it comin', I let it go
My girls will tell me, "I told you so"
But I was so intrigued by your style, boy
Always been a sucker for a wild boy

I might be gettin' what I deserve
But I ain't stickin' 'round for the re-run
What's done is done

Song title: Ciao Adiós

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Ask you once, ask you twice now
There's lipstick on your collar
You say she's just a friend now
Then why don't we call her?
So you wanna go home with someone
To do all the things you used to do to me
I swear, I know you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up
Don't know where you are
'Til I hear her say your name
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
That's a distant memory
Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha

[Chorus]
I'm onto you, yeah, you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving her all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done, uh
Ciao adios, I'm done
Ciao adios, I'm done
[Verse 2]
After three, after four times
Why did I bother?
Tell me how many more times
Does it take to get smarter?
Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
And all of the things you did to me
I swear, I know you did

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you take her out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when she rings you up
She know where you are
But I know differently
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
Making brand new memories
Hope you treat her better than you treated me

[Chorus]
I'm onto you, yeah, you
I'm not your number one (yeah)
I saw you, with her (with her)
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving her all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you (yeah, yeah)

Ciao adios, I'm done (yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no)

And now you take her out, in your fancy car

Song title: Then

[Verse 1]
We had it good, you know
I spent like six years makin' sure you came home to love
You had it good, you know
I stood by your side
I spent up so much time tryna make you happy
I don't think you ever could be happy

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you should try some therapy
Maybe you should lose a couple home boys
Give up on the homegrown
Look at me
'Cause I need you to understand

[Chorus]
Now, when you think of late nights with me there in your bed
True ride or die, that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
And when you think of my body on yours, don't forget
Once I would've died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then, oh
But that was then, ooh

[Verse 2]
You don't know shit, you know
You act this big man and you think you are in control
But you don't know shit, you know
I stood by your side, and pulled you away from your fire
Again, and again, and again
I shoulda known fire would win
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you should try some therapy
Maybe you should lose a couple homeboys
Give up on the homegrown
Look at me
'Cause I need you to understand

[Chorus]
Now, when you think of late nights with me there in your bed
True ride or die, that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
And when you think of my body on yours, don't forget
Once I would've died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then
That was then

You're gonna miss me
You're really gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me

True ride or die, that's what you had

Song title: Heavy

[Verse 1]
When did we get so lost inside ourselves?
We used to be strong, now it's like we don't care
Instead we're calling out for help
Don't know where we went wrong, but it's so hard to share (so hard to share)

[Pre-Chorus]
All this weight left on our shoulders
Too much for the both of us

[Chorus]
When did it get so heavy?
This love that's in between us
It never used to feel this
Feels so heavy (heavy)
Can't get up off the ground (up off the ground)
It's weighing us down

[Verse 2]
When did we get so bad at being honest?
You got things on your mind, that you don't wanna say
Thought that we had made a promise
That we would never get this way

[Pre-Chorus]
But all this weight left on our shoulders
Too much for the both of us
[Chorus]
When did it get so heavy?
This love that's in between us
It never used to feel this
Feels so heavy
Can't get up off the ground, yeah (up off the ground)
It's weighing us down
It's weighing us down (so heavy, baby)

[Bridge]
All these things we said that we never meant
Are we gonna let them hold us down?
All these things we said that we never meant
Are we gonna let them hold us down, down?

[Chorus]
'Cause baby it's too heavy
This love that's in between us
We never used to feel this
Feels so heavy, uh
Can't get up off the ground
Can't get up off the ground
It's weighing us down
It's weighing us down, down, down

[Outro]
So heavy
It's weighing us down, down, down
No, no, no, no, na, na, na, na
So heavy
When did it get so, when did it get so heavy?10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Bad Girlfriend

[Intro]
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend
(Huh)

[Verse 1]
You cancel plans for me, I cancel ours on you
Say I'd be back early, I don't get in 'til 2
You ask me where I've been, I tell you something vague
Think I messed up again, what can I say?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your mum said that she hates me, thinks I'm fucking lazy
Your friends keep on telling you to leave me 'cause I'm crazy
I do some shit you can't forgive
But you better get used to it

[Chorus]
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
You tell me your birthday, I forgot again
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
I can see you calling, I'm not answering
I'm laughing but I don't think that you're funny
I'm staying 'cause you give me all your money
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend (friend)
Huh, yeah

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

[Verse 2]
You make me dinner then, I order take-away
You wanna meet my friends, I say another day
You trust me with your keys and I fuck up your car
You're gonna stay with me, I break your heart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I'm one in a million, more like in a billion
I don't think it's cheating if I'm kissing other women
I do some shit you can't forgive
And you better get used to it

[Chorus]
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
You tell me your birthday, I forgot again
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
I can see you calling, I'm not answering

I'm staying 'cause you give me all your money
I'm a bad girlfriend

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl, girlfriend

[Bridge]
You should be with someone who's
Always gonna wake up with you
Always gonna tell you the truth
And not lie to you like I do
You should be with someone else
Someone who is not myself
You know I'm not good for your health
And everyone else can tell
I'm a bad girlfriend, yeah

[Outro]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl (haha, y'all)

I'm a bad bad girl (yeah)
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl, girlfriend (but you already knew that)
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl (I'm a bad, I'm a bad, bad, bad)

Song title: Perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body
Top to the bottom
I'm not a supermodel from a magazine
I'm okay with not being perfect

[Chorus]
'Cause that's perfect to me (Ooh, woah, ooh)
'Cause that's perfect to me (Ooh, woah, ooh)
'Cause that's perfect to me (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
No matter where I go, everybody stares at me
Not into fancy clothes, I'm rockin' baggy jeans
Gettin' too close for comfort but comfort is what I need
So I eat my body weight in chocolate and ice cream, huh
Maybe I bite my nails and don't think before I speak
Don't fit in any crowd, don't ever get much sleep
I wish my legs were bigger, bigger than New York City
And I'll love who I want to love, 'cause this love is gender-free

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body

(La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la, la, la, la-la)
'Cause that's perfect to me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up late and don't even brush my teeth
Just wanna stuff my face with leftover mac and cheese
You know I get depressed, are you impressed with my honesty?
Still I'll wear what I wanna  'cause I'm cool with what's underneath, mmm
I wanna kiss someone that I'll never see again
I wanna go somewhere and go there with all my friends
I wanna take my family to go and see Eminem
'Cause my sister's been in love with him since like we were 10

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks
Do what I wanna
Love every single part of my body

I'm not a supermodel from a magazine

'Cause that's perfect to me
[Bridge]
If you don't wanna wear makeup, don't wear makeup
If you don't wanna break up, then kiss and make up
Remember if you wanna, you can go home
You can say that enough is enough, ah
Alright, this is your time
Time for your life to be yours

[Outro]
Don't feel like putting makeup on my cheeks (Oh, oh)
Do what I wanna (No, no, no)
