Song title: Soon You’ll Be Gone

I never know how you do it
When you take my head and run through it
And do you even know the feeling you’re giving me at all
And do you even know the feeling you’re giving me at all

Soon you’ll be gone

And do you even know the feeling you’re giving me at allEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Lost

[Chorus]
Where's your head at with this? Move closer in
'Cause I'm all strung out without you, babe
My plans to leave are changing, for you, I'd stay
'Cause I'm all strung out without you, babe
'Cause I'm all strung out without you, babe

(I'm lost without you, babe)
(I'm lost without you, babe)
(I'm lost without you, babe)

'Cause I'm all strung out without you, babe
My plans to leave are changing, for you, I'd stay
'Cause I'm all strung out without you, babe
'Cause I'm all strung out without you, babe

(I'm lost without you, babe)
(I'm lost without you, babe)
(I'm lost without you, babe)

Song title: Vanishing

[Verse 1]
Looking up at a purple sky
On the rocks where we lay entwined
I hear the sound in the ocean cry
Hold my breath as the sparks fly

[Chorus]
Vanishing again
Every time I reach out, it's just vapor and
There's nothing there to hold on to
Vanishing again
Every time I reach out, it's just vapor so
I dive into your eyes

[Verse 2]
I see the flashing in your eyes
I can see there's no compromise
Yearning now just to hold you tight
Keep you warm until daylight

[Chorus]
Vanishing again
Every time I reach out, it's just vapor and
There's nothing there to hold on to
Vanishing again
Every time I reach out, it's just vapor so
I dive into your eyes
[Post-Chorus]
Vanishing again
Vanishing againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Close Your Eyes

Breaking down to little pieces as time goes slow
Sitting there just waiting for the lid to blow
Close your eyes now
Close your eyes now

Feeling like I’m falling backwards
It sinks in
Imagine she’s holding you and I walk in
It’s too much now
Close my eyes now

And all the love I gave you
All the time I spent
Holding you, comforting
I’d do it all again
I have no regrets

All the times I've caught you
When you were so down
I’d do it all again
But it’s over now
Over now

Close your eyes now

It's too much now
I will not fade
I’ll rise from the shade
And I’ll fall like rain
Wash away the pain

And I’m not mad at you
But now I can finally bloom
Like a flower in June
It feels good
It’s over now

Close your eyes nowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Half Moon

[Chorus]
Standin' on the cornerstone
And I hear the larks are callin', larks are callin'
And I'll be landin' on the borders of Rome
To see the kings are fallin', kings are fallin'
And we'll be brandishing our daggers at home
Until the mornin's dawnin', mornin's dawnin'
And there'll be killin' for a seat on the throne
Watch as knights are stormin', knights are stormin'
And we will tear it down

[Refrain]
And we will tear it down

[Verse]
They say it's easy to criticise in days like these
Living back side to front inside a cyanide dream
Fuelling greed, impresarios, and dressed up thieves
Clown suited in conjecture on these HD screens, before these
Whipper-snappers makin' all those toil
Bleedin' out the grease-monkeys for the cogs in the coil
This is toy town junction, this dystopian free
And this a cast iron pity if you see what they see, so I said
Fire up the machine, these shots are loaded
They're stretchin' your means, until your hands are folded
Slide up the ravine, these streets are never golden
Driving in your spleen, no blowing of emotion
No thanks and no please, they want it now or never
Where greed is the key, and I don't feel so clever
Discreet in defeat, I'm more for hell in leather
So climb on your feet, and we can make it better
[Chorus]
Standin' on the cornerstone
And I hear the larks are callin', larks are callin'
And I'll be landin' on the borders of Rome
To see the kings are fallin', kings are fallin'
And we'll be brandishing our daggers at home
Until the mornin's dawnin', mornin's dawnin'
And there'll be killin' for a seat on the throne
Watch as knights are stormin', knights are stormin'
And we will tear it down

[Refrain]
And we will tear it down

And we will tear it down

And we will tear it down

[Verse]
They say it's easy to criticise in days like these
Living back side to front inside a cyanide dream
Fuelling greed, impresarios, and dressed up thieves
Clown suited in conjecture on these HD screens, before these
Whipper-snappers makin' all those toil

This is toy town junction, this dystopian free
And this a cast iron pity if you see what they see, so I said

Song title: Nothing Without You

I don't wanna change my mind
I don't wanna walk away
From this love we've made

Am I gonna make you mine
Am I gonna keep you safe
Forever I will stay

This world is nothing without you

I don't wanna lose my mind
Watch you walk away
Let this love just fade
Are we gonna intertwine
Now every day
Forever I will stay

This world is nothing without you

I don't wanna change my mind
I don't wanna walk away
From this love we've made
Am I gonna make you mine
Am I gonna keep you safe
Forever I will stayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
