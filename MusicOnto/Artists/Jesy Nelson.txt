Song title: Boyz

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, it's the UK baddie and the Barbie

[Verse 1: Jesy Nelson]
Love a little bitter in the sweet
Bad boy, my recipe
Bein' nice a little borin' when you in between the sheets
When I ride that hee-haw, you know I know how to please ya

[Refrain: Jesy Nelson]
Ooh, I like them tattoos and them gold teeth
Type to make me feel like I'm a baddie
I like the fire you're bringin' out of me
Baby, somethin' 'bout him got me weak in the knees

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
The hold that you got should be criminal
My mama won't see what I see in ya
But I don't want it if it ain't bad enough
I don't know what it is, I

[Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
I like a bad, bad boy (Boy)
You know I like a bad, bad boy (Boy)
I like a bad boy, you can't stop me
I love bad boys for life
I like a bad, bad boy (Bad boy)
You know I like a bad, bad boy (Bad boy)
I like a bad boy, you can't stop me
I love bad boys for life
[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson]
Got a little attitude, but I think he's kinda cute
So hood, so good, so damn taboo
Know you know how to please me
Like it raw, baby, sashimi

[Refrain: Jesy Nelson]
Ooh, I like them tattoos and them gold teeth
Type to make me feel like I'm a baddie
I like the fire you're bringin' out of me
Baby, somethin' 'bout him got me weak in the knees

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
The hold that you got should be criminal
My mama won't see what I see in ya
But I don't want it if it ain't bad enough
I don't know what it is, I

[Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
I like a bad, bad boy (Boy)
You know I like a bad, bad boy (Boy)
I like a bad boy, you can't stop me
I love bad boys for life
I like a bad, bad boy (Bad boy)
You know I like a bad, bad boy (Boy)
I like a bad boy, you can't stop me
I love bad boys for life
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
(As we proceed, to give you what you need)
Bad bitches want a bad boy (Come on)
Word to Biggie, Diddy, and Mase (Woo)
Woah, like Rob, won't find a prettier face (Let's go)
He gon' keep my VVS's dancing like Total
So I could just shine while he shoot up the place (Prrr)
Raspberries, cherries, and berries, I'm edible
Do these bitches like a library, done read 'em all
My body smokin', come get a pull
Lucky charms on my anklets, no, not cereal
Jesy, we got all these jelly bitches actin' real messy
Still a bad bitch whether I'm sporty or I'm dressy
I don't know why I got these dudes actin' zesty
But I only want a bad boy as my bestie

[Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
I like a bad, bad boy
You know I like a bad, bad boy (Gotta, gotta have a bad boy)
I like a bad boy, you can't stop me
I love bad boys for life (Ooh, want a bad, bad boy)
I like a bad, bad boy
You know I like a bad, bad boy
I like a bad boy, you can't stop me
I love bad boys for life
[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
It's Nicki and Jesy
He love me, and plus he
Ready to knock a motherfucker out just to impress me (Woo)17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Addicted To Your Love

[Verse 1: Jesy]
Sometimes I feel down when I know your not around and I'm hoping you'll knock on my door
It's been too long and I'm starting to miss you again and I'm hoping that this ain't the end
You said this was love but how can this be when you left me here all alone
I spent too many nights crying over these fights and I don't think I can take anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy]
But baby I love you
Promise me you'll never take your love away
Cause baby
I need you baby and it's so true
Did you ever think I'd stay away?

[Chorus: Jesy & G Duddah]
We are going round and round
We always do the same things baby I can't take it
I hope that we can make it
My heart feels like it's racing
You're my mеdication
I'm addicted to your love
We arе going round and round
We always do the same things baby I can't take it
I hope that we can make it
My heart feels like it's racing
You're my medication
I'm addicted to your love
[Verse 2: G Duddah]
I was always feeling down
But you made me happy
So I held you down thinking that just maybe you would stick around, you would stick around, you would stick around
You're the one who changed me
Brought out the best in me
Baby, it's like you made me, haha
You think that I'm crazy
You made me feel bad about myself
And I just wish I never said so many bad things
Cause I don't mean what I'm saying to you
Sometimes I just get right out and lie I need to wait a minute
Calm myself down and just let time pass
Cause I ain't done with this
I ain't done with this no
I ain't finished with you girl

[Chorus: Jesy & G Duddah]
We are going round and round
We always do the same things baby I can't take it
I hope that we can make it
My heart feels like it's racing
You're my medication
I'm addicted to your love
We are going round and round
We always do the same things baby I can't take it
I hope that we can make it
My heart feels like it's racing
You're my medication
I'm addicted to your loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: We’re Okay, Baby

[Intro]
You are my baby, oh

[Verse 1]
Baby, I have been feeling kinda lonely today
My heart is broken and I feel confused
I need you to stay
No matter how long that you stay away
I need you some more
You are my love, my shining star
Everything that I adore

[Chorus]
You keep telling me there's something wrong
But there's not, we're okay, baby
There is no way
That I'm gonna lose you now that you're mine
I can tell by your smile
We'll set the time, we can make it through this
Baby, there is nothing wrong
Until we realize that our love is strong

[Verse 2]
Maybe if wе gave this time
We could makе it right
Just need to put my past behind us
And forget all the fights
And you know that I'm always gonna love you
And I hope you'll love me
'Cause there's a space inside my heart for you
Why can't you see?
[Chorus]
You keep telling me there's something wrong
But there's not, we're okay, baby
There is no way
That I'm gonna lose you now that you're mine
I can tell by your smile
We'll set the time, we can make it through this
Baby, there is nothing wrong
Until we realize that our love is strong

[Verse 3]
You keep on makin' me feel happy
Tellin' me that you love me
Then keep bringing me down
We gotta do this together
We're in this forever
Baby, it's me and you

[Chrous]
You keep telling me there's something wrong
But there's not, we're okay, baby
There is no way
That I'm gonna lose you now that you're mine
I can tell by your smile
We'll set the time, we can make it through this
Baby, there is nothing wrong
Until we realize that our love is strong
You keep telling me there's something wrong
But there's not, we're okay, baby
There is no way
That I'm gonna lose you now that you're mine
I can tell by your smile
We'll set the time, we can make it through this
Baby, there is nothing wrong
Until we realize that our love is strong

Song title: Said Too Much

(Lyrics from snippet)

[Chorus]
I thought that you would call this love, love
No you can't take it back
I think you might've said too much
Man, you really messed me up
I thought that you would call this love, love
No, you can't take it back
But I think you might have said too much

[Verse 2]
I can glue back broken glasses
But I can't fix what you were smashingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
