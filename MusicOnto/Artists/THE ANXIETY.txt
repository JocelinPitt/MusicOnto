Song title: Meet Me at Our Spot

[Verse 1: Willow]
When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

[Chorus: Willow]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Verse 2: Tyler Cole]
When I go to sleep
I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me
Feel it taking over me
But when I'm older I'll be moving onward
I just got a drunk text
(Meet me at our spot)
[Chorus: Tyler Cole]
We caught a vibe (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
When I look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna hold you all night (All night)
Maybe we can take a drive (Take a drive)
Baby, we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

[Bridge: Willow & Tyler Cole]
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there
Meet me at our spot
Got something I wanna show you
Meet me at our spot
They can't find us there

[Chorus: Willow]
Caught a vibe (Woo, woo)
Baby, are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night, night
When we take a drive (Woo, woo)
Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Poolside

[Chorus: Willow]
They say they wanna kick it poolside
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real
Think they can handle the real poolside
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real
Handle the real...

[Post-Chorus: Willow]
I don't need to tell 'em
'Cause they won't understand
I don't need to tell 'em
I don't need to tell 'em

I don't need to tell 'em
'Cause they won't understand
I don't need to tell 'em
I don't need to tell 'em

[Chorus: Willow]
They say they wanna kick it poolside
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real poolside
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real
Handle the real, handle the real
[Verse 1: Tyler Cole]
They wanna kick it poolside, ay
We been on the PCH
I grew up in the TC bay
Nah we ain’t on the same page
We're the real in the west side, ay
We're the real in the east side, ay
We're the real in the north side, ay
We're the real in the south side, ay

[Chorus: Tyler Cole & Willow]
Poolside, but we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real
Handle the real...
(Because they say they wanna keep it poolside)
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real
Handle the real, handle the real

[Post-Chorus: Willow]
I don't need to tell 'em
'Cause they won't understand
I don't need to tell 'em
I don't need to tell 'em

I don't need to tell 'em
'Cause they won't understand
I don't need to tell 'em
I don't need to tell 'em
[Verse 2: Tyler Cole]
They say they wanna kick it
Poolside or the Oceanside
I’ll be fine when the earth is fire
If you wanna fly we can take a flight
Ego strikes these are scary times
Me no like these racist whites
If you wanna fight we can fight the fight
I don’t even try I just live my life
I don’t wanna die but I’ll die for my rights

[Bridge: Willow]
Poolside or the Oceanside
Ima be fine when the earth is ice
I only give love I don’t take advice
Got to resist got to fight the fight
Me no like these racist whites
Ego strikes these are scary times
Creepin all up in the night
If they pull up no we ain’t gonna hide

[Outro: Willow]
They say they wanna kick it poolside
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real poolside
But we're on the beach
I don't think they can handle the real
Handle the real, handle the real...3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: After You Cry

[Chorus: Both]
If you saw me, would you want me?
If you're lonely, would you call me?
Will you treat me so appalling?
Baby, you can hit me later right after you cry

[Verse 1: Tyler Cole]
I've got a hundred million things I gotta square away
I ain't slept in like a week, I ain't prepared today
And on top of it there’s ash inside my air today
And I speak before I think I do it carelessly
Do you really wanna be something? (Do you?)
Do you ever think of me sometimes?
Do you ever even see the Suns when they pass in your bed after you cry?
(After you cry)

[Verse 2: Willow]
If you love me, if you hate me
Yeah, I know I
It won't change me
I'm the only one that is around when you call
You're the only one that is around when I fall
Are you seeing anything about what we've been through at all?
After you cry

[Chorus: Tyler Cole]
If you saw me, would you want me?
If you're lonely, would you call me?
Will you treat me so appalling?
Baby, you can hit me later right after you cry
[Post-Chorus]
(After you cry-y-y-y-y)
(After you cry)
Oh, oh
(After you cry-y-y-y-y)
Oh, oh
(After you cry-y-y-y-y)

[Outro: Willow & Tyler Cole]
Oh, after you cry
Oh, after you cry
Oh, after you cry
Oh, after you cry...
Oh, after you cry...
Oh, after you cry...3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been looking for some hope, I need that

I've been looking for some hope, I need that

I was just a kid now I’m grown (Now I’m grown)
Lately I’ve been looking for some hope (Hella hope)
Baby I’ve been feeling so alone

I was walking down the street in my black skin
Feeling hella proud to be in my black skin
Hey mama look at me in my black skin
I was killed by the police in my black skin

I've been looking for some hope, I need that

Song title: Entertain

[Intro: Willow]
(It's mad, it's-it's mad)

[Chorus: Willow]
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh, I know it’s taken a toll
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh I know it’s taken a toll

[Verse 1: Tyler Cole]
I ain't seen you in a minute, you give me the side-eye
Had to get away, I got on a red eye
When I'm talking to you I want you look into my eyes
Came all the way to see you from west side
And my best friend said he gonna move to Bed-Stuy
I might hit the road, will you come for the ride?
Tell me if it's real love or if it's time to sign out
I guess I'ma find out

[Chorus: Willow & Tyler Cole]
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh, I know it’s taken a toll
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh I know it’s taken a toll
[Verse 2: Willow]
I ain't seen you in a minute, you give me the side-eye
Had to get away, I got on a red eye
When I'm talking to you I want you to look into my eyes
3am I'm walking and the stars are in the sky
I gotta detach and they just always ask me why
Try to explain myself and it just really don’t feel right
So what choice do I have if I'm tryna get through the day?

[Chorus: Willow & Tyler Cole]
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh, I know it’s taken a toll
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh I know it’s taken a toll

[Bridge: Willow & Tyler Cole]
Top down in the hills
If you wanna ride with me then it's chill
Pure strength, pure will
But you know I'm going in for the kill
Feel pain, think I'm gonna reach my threshold
Feel rage 'cause they never understand, no
No love for a nigga in this time zone
So what choice do I have when I'm tryna get through in the day?
[Chorus: Willow & Tyler Cole]
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh, I know it’s taken a toll
All your entertaining
Time and money wasted
Oh I know it’s taken a toll2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

I've been waiting for this day
Do you feel the same way?
Will you walk towards me?
