Song title: You Broke Up with Me

[Verse 1]
Well, I got some Coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way, way back, back in my swagger
X-Factor, feelin' no pain, I'm at the top of my game

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Verse 2]
Guess you don't know what you want
'Til you see 'em movin' on
Making lonely look like freedom
Baby, don't even act like I'm doing something wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours
[Pre-Chorus]
You can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't start raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

[Bridge]
For real, babe, ain't tryin' to rub it your face
I'm just breakin' off a little cold hard truth
It is what it is, girl, you did whatcha did, girl
I'm just doin' what a bachelor do

[Pre-Chorus]
Darlin', you can't crash my party with your sorry's and what are we's
Don't be raining on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin', girl, you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)
[Chorus]
Whoa, girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No, girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe, you broke up with me

You broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say, babe?
You broke up with me6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Fancy Like

[Verse 1]
Ayy
My girl is bangin', she's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne-poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
[Verse 2]
Uh
Don't need no Tesla to impress her (Don't need no Tesla to impress her)
My girl is happy rollin' on a Vespa (There she go)
Don't need no mansion to get romancin' (Ooh, woo)
She's super fine, double wide, slow dancin' (Slow dancin')

[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

[Bridge]
My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without  theSkoal in 'em
Yeah, she probably gon' be keepin' some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine, then her up-do goes down
[Chorus]
Ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: 90's Country

[Verse 1]
Strawberry wine on your lips got me amazed
How 'bout you let this cowboy take you away?
Gimme that wink, I'ma give it right back
You know you like it, you love it, you want some more of that

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me smile like I did when we were radio kids
Catching that countdown on Sunday, all the way to one day

[Chorus]
Whenever
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
Got me spinning like a jukebox junkie
Making me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you

[Verse 2]
You see that water tower? Girl, we can dream on it
I'ma paint your name in John Deere green on it
I, I cross my heart, I ain't no walk-away Joe
I'm gonna get you to the church on Cumberland Road
[Pre-Chorus]
And you get sweeter with time
Just like that bottle of wine
Might be a little dust on it but
Won't it taste so fine? (Just like you)

[Chorus]
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
I'm sold to the lady in the front seat
Making me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you
You make me feel like 90's country

[Bridge]
You know you're beautiful, don't act like you don't
Ain't settling for no burger and no grape snow cone, not tonight

[Chorus]
Do you love me? If you do, check yes, please
Girl, you know you think my tractor's sexy
I ain't in it for your daddy's money
You make me feel like 90's country
You make me feel like 90's country
Shake it vidalia
Queen of my double wide trailer
Million songs I could list you
But I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you
Baby, don't be stupid, you know I love you
Blame it all on my roots when I turned up at 90's country2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Beckett

[Intro: Beckett Hayes]
My name’s Beckett and I’m 4

[Verse 1]
Well cereal's his favorite food group
Doin’ the Heisman with a box of Fruit Loops
Spoon hangin' off his nose just cuz he can
Bedhead like Edward Scissorhands
Damn proud of that belly button
Ain’t suckin' it in for nothin’
4 years old looks like fun to me

[Chorus]
When I grow up I wanna be like Beckett
Eatin' breakfast butt naked
Ain’t even tryin’ to be famous
Just wonderin' where his airplane is
Don’t know if he’s rich or poor
Says it’s cool that the girl next door
Has skin like chocolate
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett

[Beckett: "Where’s my airplane? I like the fat Froot Loops"]

You get it, B
[Verse 2]
Shakes it when there ain’t no music
Takes advantage of the bathtub acoustics
Little Foo Fighter with a shampoo mohawk
Owns it with no alcohol
Don’t know the minute hand from the hour
I see a weed, he sees a flower
Prays like he’s on the phone with Jesus

[Chorus]
When I grow up I wanna be just like Beckett
Eatin' breakfast butt naked
Ain’t even tryin’ to be famous
Just wonderin' where is airplane is
Don’t know if he’s rich or poor
Says it’s cool that the boy next door
Has two dads and three pets
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett

[Beckett: "Where’s my airplane? I like the fat Froot Loops"]

Wanna be just like you, Beck
Come on, B
He likes the fat Froot Loops
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett
Eatin’ breakfast butt naked
Ain’t even tryin’ to be famous
Just wonderin’ where his airplane is
Don’t know if he’s rich or poor
Says it’s cool that the girl next door
Has a dot on her forehead
When I grow up, when I grow up
I wanna be like Beckett

[Beckett: "Where’s my airplane? I like the fat Froot Loops"]

Wanna be like you, Beck
You get it, get it, that's right
He likes the fat Froot LoopsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Beautiful

[Verse 1]
Rode all the way down memory lane where 65 ends
Wonderin’ how it’d feel to see the one that got away again
Hopin’ it might go down like that hometown unanswered prayer
My hero sang about on an old burned CD we shared

[Verse 2]
Somethin' on the interstate told me I was headed straight for your pretty storm
That the hurt was still gonna be there just like your name on my arm
Even got real with a girl I chill with up in Chapel Hill
Told her you were gonna be here just in case my heart was still in Mobile..

[Chorus]
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful

[Verse 3]
Ain’t no tellin’, girl, how long it’s been since we did all that shoutin'
Prolly, 10 months 27 days, somethin’ like that but hey, who’s countin’
Oh, you know, just livin’ the dream, home is where the bus is
I could say time looks fine on you but it wouldn’t do it justice, it wouldn’t do it justice

[Chorus]
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
[Bridge]
I don’t think your stomach’s supposed to hurt quite like this
When you run into a girl you forgot you missed
It’s like the space between us only made me numb
Thought I could just see you and be okay but I’m not okay girl
Tell me that smile on your face is so fake and that
It’s all comin’ back, comin’ back, comin’ back
I just have to ask, have to ask, have to ask

[Chorus]
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful
Baby, why do you have to be so beautiful2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Don’t Let Her

[Verse 1]
She always said if something ever
Happened to me, she would never
Fall in love again, oh, what a waste
We always said we go together
But if I'm just half of her forever
This goes out to whoever takes my place

[Chorus]
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies, hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her

[Verse 2]
She's insecure about her legs, right?
Something wrong with her hair, right?
Just tell her she's crazy (Crazy)
Even though she won't believe you, nah
Best advice I can give you, brother
Don't ever say she's acting just like her mother
Even though she does sometimes (Sometimes)
It's gon' be our little secret
[Chorus]
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies (Loves babies), hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let her

[Bridge]
Make her feel better
Say something funny, say something 'bout the weather
Tell her wherever I am, I'm good (I'm good)
And if she's thinking she can love again, she should, understood?
Orchids, that's her favorite flower
Don't ever watch The Office without her
After church (After church), she gon' talk (She gon' talk)
Her favourite season is football

[Chorus]
She don't give two sips 'bout money
Likes a little coffee in her honey
Let her sleep late as she wants
Home is her favorite restaurant
Don't you dare come home if you're hammered
Better watch your mouth and your grammar
She loves babies, hates glitter
You better shave 'fore you kiss her
And if she ever misses me
Please, don't let herEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Craig

[Verse 1]
I met Craig at a church called Redeeming Grace
Like he understood my "I don't want to be here" face
I felt out of place and I smelled like beer
But he just shook my hand, said "I'm glad you're here"
He said "we'll all be judged"
But he was never judgemental
And even though my songs don't belong in no hymnal
He'd quote me my lyrics, slap me on the back
Said "Man you've got a gift! How you write like that?"

[Chorus]
I know, he sounds cool right?
Not your typical kid from Sunday School, right?
I still ain't figured out church yet
But Craig, I get
Nah he can't walk on water, turn the Napa Valley red
But he just might be tight with a man that did
Yeah he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is

[Verse 2]
You lose a record deal, all the perks fade fast
Dealership said, "We're going to need to get that mini-van back"
So we were down on one car
And broke as I felt
My wife and six kids with only five seat belts
I needed help but couldn't admit, I was strong
Said, "Craig, it's all good"
But he knew it all wasn't
A "Hey man I'm praying for you" would've been sufficient but nah
He took roadside assistance to a
Whole other level, to sacrificial heights
Showed up at the ballpark after my son's game one night
In two cars, with his wife Barb watching from the other
Said "What in the world are y'all doing here, brother?"
He just laughed inside that old Chrysler Town and Country van
With the keys, and a title, and a pen in his hand
Said "Man, all you got to do is sign and it's yours"
I said "No, no way"
But he wouldn't take "No" for an answer
Said "Please do
Somebody did this for me once, just let me do this for you"
We argued about it for a little while
Then I teared up, and Craig smiled
[Chorus]
I know, he sounds cool right?
Not your typical kid from Sunday School, right?
Nah he can't walk on water, turn the Napa Valley red
But he just might be tight with a man that did
Yeah he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is
Nah he's not the light of the world
But I wish that mine was bright as his
Yeah he just might be tight with a man that is

[Verse 3]
My pride was way too ashamed to be adequately grateful at the moment
But I signed the dotted line, and I drove the kids home
And when the cop pulled up beside us
At the light, they didn't have to duck
Because thanks to Craig
They were all buckled upEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Shut Up Kenny

[Verse 1]
You gotta be kidding me, Chesney
Every time I turn the ignition
You're on the radio again and in the shotgun of my vision
There she is, where she was, where she's not
Thanks a lot, man
Ain't like my heart needs your help in the breaking department
Yeah, she's already got that taken care of
No offense, but

[Chorus]
Shut up, Kenny
Leave me alone
Keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
C'mon, Kenny
Man, you know I like your music
But I hate the way I love the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't
Damn
Shut up, Kenny

[Verse 2]
Kenny, please
Hell, even your new tracks hurt
Your voice is like a mean time machine, it only goes backwards
Ain't a station you ain't on, need to change it but I don't really want to
I just keep loving her
And hating you
[Chorus]
Shut up, Kenny
Leave me alone
Keep your songs to yourself
Why you gotta sound just like she felt
When your stuff was the shit we drove around to
And even your sad songs were fun to make out to
C'mon, Kenny
Man, you know I like your music
But I hate the way I love the way it hurts when I listen to it
I know I need to rip the radio out the dash but I can't
Damn
Shut up, Kenny

[Repeat Chorus]

You're on the radio again and in the shotgun of my vision
There she is, where she was, but she's not
Thanks a lot, man
Ain't like my heart needs your help in the breaking department4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Mind Candy

[Verse 1]
Don’t know what your perfume was called
But sometimes when I’m walking through the mall
I get a little hit of whatever it was
And I take a little trip back to two-thousand and us
Learnin’ whatcha learn behind the gym
I can see you bite your lip again and again
Like It’s 3:08 on a Tuesday afternoon in Mobile
22 minutes left to kiss till I gotta get to the football field (damn)
Just like that Willie song
Girl, you’re always on my...

[Chorus]
Mind candy, sideline candy
Pretty post game dose with a lime candy
Little piece of why school was high
Make a pop rock, wanna be my
Valentine candy, sublime candy
Back seat back in time candy
Can’t help but smile like I stole it
Every breath you took baby I still hold it
17 years new in that used Blazer
All that yesterlove I savor
Baby, you’re my go to flavor
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
I said Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
[Verse 2]
Felt like a king with my Mardi Gras date
Up on my shoulders at all of the parades
My queen, you made it rain beads on the square
And all the guys stood behind us watchin’ your fineness up there
And I didn’t even care

[Chorus]
Mind candy, sideline candy
Pretty post game dose with a lime candy
Little piece of why school was high
Make a tic tac, wanna be my
Valentine candy, sublime candy
Back seat back in time candy
Can’t help but smile like I stole it
Every breath you took baby I still hold it
17 years young in that theater
Whisperin’ “we’ll just rent it later"
Baby, you’re my go to flavor
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
I said Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my

[Bridge]
My train of thought derails
Down that rain rinsed azalea trail
Past your waistband elastic when our rock wasn’t classic yet
I can almost kiss your neck
Taste you on my breath
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
[Chorus]
Mind candy, sideline candy
Pretty post game dose with a lime candy
Little piece of why school was high
Make a pop rock, wanna be
Valentine candy, sublime candy
Back seat back in time candy
Can’t help but smile like I stole it
Every breath you took baby I still hold it
17 years new in that used Blazer
All that yesterlove I savor
Baby, you’re my go to flavor
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
I said Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my
Mind candy, my mind candy, my, my

Song title: Halloween

[Verse 1: Walker Hayes]
Before I even learned to play a note, I was on stage
Mastering the art of selling myself at a young age
Fear and insecurity drove me like a Maserati
High school was like showing up at a costume party
I was a comedian, an athlete
A golden boy, a black sheep
Whatever I had to be to make the world throw candy at me
And college was the same act, different play
It was October 31st every day
And the real world was an all too familiar street
Another trick, another treat

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
Then I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
And it was like

[Chorus: Nicolle Galyon]
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
[Verse 2: Walker Hayes]
Hell, I don’t know why I’m like this
But what would it change if I knew
Maybe my parents messed up
But, hey, they’re just dressed up kids too
Maybe I guess what I’m trying to say is I love you
For being somebody I’m not ashamed to introduce my skeletons to
I still put on my Superman cape and hide in it
But when I’m with you it comes untied for a minute
Hits the ground in the shadow of your skin
For the first time I was comfortable in mine

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
It was like

[Chorus: Nicolle Galyon]
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
(When I knocked on your door)
Every mask I ever wore
Shattered like glass on the floor
It was like

[Chorus: Nicolle Galyon & Walker Hayes]
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
Halloween ended
To all the people I pretended to be
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace

[Outro: Nicolle Galyon & Walker Hayes]
Halloween ended
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
To all the people I pretended to be
Halloween ended
Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Halloween ended
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
To all the people I pretended to be
Halloween ended
When I knock-knock-knocked on your door
Rest in peaceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
