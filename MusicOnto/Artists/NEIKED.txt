Song title: Sand & Lead

[Verse 1]
Find me at the water's edge if you wanna
See you on the ocean bed if you're gonna
Fill my boots with sand and lead if you wanna
Fill my boots with sand and lead
Shall I bring the torch to kill the shadows?
I'll take the wheel if you do the pedals
Bobble back and forth, the spirit levels
Fill my boots with sand and lead

[Pre-Chorus]
Who do you hold on to
When we're passing through
And the air so fine?

[Chorus]
As the city sleeps, we can all be free
Will you follow or break away?
Simple even sea, whispers on the beach
Will you follow or break away?

[Verse 2]
Find me at the water's edge if you wanna
See you on the ocean bed if you're gonna
Fill my boots with sand and lead if you wanna
Fill my boots with sand and lead
[Pre-Chorus]
Who do you hold on to
When we're passing through
And the air so fine?

[Chorus]
As the city sleeps, we can all be free
Will you follow or break away?
Simple even sea, whispers on the beach
Will you follow or break away?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

A monument in every park
You'll love me forever
At least another thousand years
Millenniums without a tear

No one else made sense of me
You know me by heart
Legends for the rest of time
Your name resting next to mine
Never apart

Song title: Been a Long Time

[Intro]
Yah, little Indo on the mic
What's up, what's up?
Little Indo on the mic

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long time, been a long, long time
Since I've been around town, been around town
Been around town, been around downtown (God damn)
It's all about the vibe (All about the)
It's all about the way I rhyme (All about the what?)
It's all about the prime time
Ah yeah, ah yeah (Tell it to 'em straight, Indo)
It's been a rough time, been a rough time
Been enough time, been enough rough times (So dry)
I don't know about you, but I know about me
And I know I wanna know about you
I zig-zag as I take the throne
Sleazy little Indo gonna take you home
Okay, 'cause I walk like I talk
Aw, shit

[Chorus]
Yeah, aha, oh yeah
Aha, oh yeah
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha, oh yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Little Indo on the mic again

[Verse 2]
I want a good time, want a good time
Want a good time, yeah, I want good time
I just wanna chill, we could just chill
Take a chill pill, then I give it to you real
Talking 'bout the "L" to the "O" to the "V" and "E"
When motherfuckers say they wanna piece of me
I just swag (Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag)
I keep it one hundred, man
Well I don't wanna be another brother
Just your mother's lover
Animated, fated to be sated
Once you made it, baited not to instigate it
But to fade it, cater to the relegated
Underrated, jaded and berated
I'll state it, feel me taste the fever
Free the need to feed the heathen within reason or
They'll catch you clean, redeemed
Unseen, foreseen, inshallah, she will cream
Yah, what's up, what's up?

[Chorus]
Yeah, aha, oh yeah
Aha, oh yeah
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha, oh yeah
[Bridge]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long time, been a long, long time
Since I've been around town, been around town
Been around town, been around downtown
Talking about the "L" to the "O" to the "V" and "E"
When motherfuckers say they want a piece of me
I just swag (Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag)
I keep it one hundred, man

[Chorus]
Yeah, aha, oh yeah
Aha, oh yeah
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha, oh yeah

[Outro]
I keep it one hundred, man1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1]
Rider med prestige och pistoler
Du ser ensam ut
Predikade revolutioner
Men snart är livet slut

Alla vill leva men alla ska dö
Det var det enda jag lärde dig
Vart ska du?
Vart ska du?
Vart ska du?

Höll din kalla hand sista dagen
Du visslar psalmer
All kärlek, allt hat, alla slagen
Cowboy ta, cowboy ge

Alla vill leva men alla ska dö
Det var det enda jag lärde dig
Vart ska du?
Vart ska du?
Vart ska du?

Song title: Lifestyle

[Verse 1]
Why you even bother?
Why actin' like I'm wanted?
You know me, I'm a firestarter
'Cause I tend to ignite and it might burn
I don't even bother, yeah
I just do it how I wanna
I know me, I'm bound to break a promise
No offense, don't make sense, that's who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
How come you still think it's just a phase?
Don't know why
Can't you see I'm hopelessness embraced?
I'm doin' okay

[Chorus]
Keep messing up my lifestyle
Never make it on time
Realize in hindsight 'cause I'm a fool
Smilin' upside down now
'Cause I ruined date night
Tryna make a joke 'bout how I'm a fool

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not in a mood, not being rude
I'm just a tool missing a screw
Keep messing up my lifestyle
Messing up a lifetime
Messing up 'til I die 'cause I'm a fool
[Verse 2]
I don't know where it started, no
I've always made it harder for myself
That's kind of how I want it
I get lost in my thoughts and I like it there
When you get all frustrated
I'm laughing, I'm laughing, I'm laughing it out
Being bummed is overrated
You should eat what I serve, think it over

[Pre-Chorus]
How come you still think it's just a phase?
Don't know why
Can't you see I'm hopelessness embraced?
I'm doin' okay

[Chorus]
Keep messing up my lifestyle
Never make it on time
Realize in hindsight 'cause I'm a fool
Smilin' upside down now
'Cause I ruined date night
Tryna make a joke 'bout how I'm a fool

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not in a mood, not being rude
I'm just a tool missing a screw
Keep messing up my lifestyle
Messing up a lifetime
Messing up 'til I die 'cause I'm a fool
[Bridge]
When you get all frustrated I'm laughing it out
My wits are dislocated, I'm rolling without
Say I'm sorry, I'm sorry but you should know
I'm not really, I'm happy, you should know by now
That I'm just a hopeless case, I hope it's okay

[Chorus]
Keep messing up my lifestyle
Never make it on time
Realize in hindsight 'cause I'm a fool
Smilin' upside down now
'Cause I ruined date night
Tryna make a joke 'bout how I'm a fool

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not in a mood, not being rude
I'm just a tool missing a screw
Keep messing up my lifestyle
Messing up a lifetime
Messing up 'til I die 'cause I'm a fool

[Outro]
Keep messing my, messing my
Keep messing up my lifestyle 'cause I'm a fool1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
