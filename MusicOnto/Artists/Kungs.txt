Song title: I Feel So Bad

[Verse 1]
I feel so bad
That I might have led you wrong
When I met you, I was so in love
I didn't think that I could be strong, but, but
Things started slipping
Thought they'd go back to how they were
Should've been honest sooner
Before things got so much worse

[Pre-Drop]

[Drop]
Ayy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
You made us change
Way back when we were fine
Way back when I, I loved you
You couldn't tame your mind
I, I loved you for who you were
Not for that girl that you thought you could be
Now I can't believe
This is happening to me
[Pre-Drop]
Oh, tryna bring me closer
But you're not pushing me away
Baby, I won't love you any better
If you continue to make us change
Oh, oh, tryna bring me closer
But you're not pushing me away
Baby, I won't love you any better
If you continue to make us change, ayy

[Drop]
Ayy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, oh, baby1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Na-na-na-na (woo!)
Na-na-na-yeah (woo!)
Na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
I'm so, so done of waiting
Got my glory days in sight
Got my glory days in sight, oh yeah
Gotta find my fears and face them
Get day back on my side
Get day back on my side, oh yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
The hard times have been the longest battle for me (oh oh, hey yo)
But freedom's inside, it's time to take what I need (oh oh, hey yo)

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
[Verse 2: Coely]
Yeah, I've been down in the deep end
Uh, but now I know how to roll
Went through the struggle for a reason
Can't get in, they got a foot against the door
Tired of the tension, tired of the waiting
Tired of the day shift, uh
I've been tripping in the Matrix, time for me to face it
Tying up my laces, finna get wild
So shine and get shine
Well, you can't imitate, it's all mine
Better make the mistakes, it's go time
Get up off that thing, it's alright
I keep bleeding, I'ma teach you to heal up
Join the force you know 'cause you can't beat us
I'ma seize the moment that I live
But I don't mess up my thing

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
The hard times have been the longest battle for me (oh oh, hey yo)
But freedom's inside, it's time to take what I need (oh oh, hey yo)

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
More mess on my thing
[Outro: Olly Murs]
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, waiting, oh
I'm done with waiting, waiting, oh1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: This Girl [Extended]

[Intro]
Don’t need money
Don’t need money
Don’t need money

[Verse 1]
Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change 'cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love!
No other thing that’s as precious to
No other! There’s no other
Than a heart that feel and a heart that’s true
Somethin’ that you’ve got to know this girl

[Chorus]
Woh!
Take my hand...
Or them over Take my hand...you
O-or them over
Take my hand ... you
Or them over
Take my hand
Or them over

[Verse 2]
His presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love!
You buy me this and you buy me that
To win over! Win me over!
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Somethin' that you've got to love this...
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
It's a shame but I've got to go
[Chorus]
Woh!
Take my hand...
Or them over
Take my hand... you
O-or them over
Take my hand... you
Or them over
Take my hand
Or them over1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Dopamine

[Verse 1: JHart]
I'm going out so I'm not in my head
Can't be alone, I got a million friends
Breathing the smoke up in a crowded room
Everyone smiling like it's crystal clear
Can't figure out exactly why I'm here
Feeling the high but I'll be low real soon

[Chorus: JHart]
I'm not okay but I'm okay
Losing my mind but I'm alright
As long as I always keep, chasing that dopamine

[Verse 2: JHart]
Hope the champagne will wash the pain away
When I wake up I'll need a new escape
Say it's the last time like I always do
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Pick up the phone to make a random call
Can't stand the silence so I guess I'll talk
All of my friends they got the same issues

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night, distraction like a chemical reaction
We can't help ourselves
[Chorus: JHart]
I'm not okay but I'm okay
Losing my mind but I'm alright
As long as I always keep, chasing that dopamine
I'm not a mess but I'm a mess
Losing my mind but I'm alright
As long as I always keep, chasing that dopamine

[Post-Chorus]
Chasing that dopamine1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Melody

[Verse 1]
Rumors rolling around my brain
I don't know what to believe
But honestly nothing could hold me back
Wanna be part of your scene
You are the best that I ever had
You make me walk in a dream
Silk summer undo your hair
You make me walk in a dream

[Chorus]
Your melody, melody, melody sings to me
Your melody, melody dream
A melody, melody, melody sings to me
A melody, melody dream
Melody, melody, melody sings to me
Your melody, melody dream
A melody, melody, melody sings to me
A melody, melody dream

[Post-Chorus]
A silk sun, silk sun, silk sun
Melody dream

[Verse 2]
Rumors walking around my brain
But you make me believe
I see the danger that's in your eyes
You live life to be free
But I don't know how to contain you
You make me walk in a dream
Under the silk of the moon of you
You make me walk in a dream
[Chorus]
Your melody, melody, melody sings to me
Your melody, melody dream
A melody, melody, melody sings to me
A melody, melody dream
Melody, melody, melody sings to me
Your melody, melody dream
A melody, melody, melody sings to me
A melody, melody dream

Song title: Trust

[Verse 1]
Show them all we won't be cornered
We will not be terrified
Show them all we won't take orders
We just want a good night

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll come (at you)
What can we do to win this? (nothing yet)
We are against the lions
I don't wanna
Live in wonder
So we gotta
Send them under

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up
In the same old bed again
Tried to escape them
They really make it hard
We need more trust

[Verse 2]
Show them all we won't be cornered
We will not be terrified
Show them all we won't take orders
We just want a good night
[Pre-Chorus]
We came (at you)
What did we do to win this? (everything)
We were against the lions
Now we're gonna
Live in splendour
Our elders
Will remember

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wake up
In the same old bed again
Tried to escape them
They really make it hard
We need more trust

[Outro]
If you can hear me right now
Everybody take a bow
We just tore the roof down
Remind them this is our townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: When You’re Gone

[Verse 1]
I remember how it feels
Lying in your tattooed arms
Everything was so surreal
Until it all went wrong, it all went wrong

Other boys come and other boys go
Caught up in your undertow
They try to hold me close
But I'm clinging to your ghost

[Verse 2]
Well the clock keeps ticking on
Your memory starts to fade
But then I hear your song
And you're back to me like a melody

Other boys come and other boys go
Living in your shadow
They try to pull me in
But I'm drifting off again

[Chorus]
I'm looking for a lost boy caught up in the haze
Searching night and day for you
Cause I'm lost boy while you slip away
Can't you see I'm sleeping too?
When you're gone, gone
When you're gone, gone
I can't, I can't hold on
When you're gone
[Bridge]
I keep searching, I keep searching, I keep searching, for you...
I keep searching, I keep searching, I keep searching, for you...

[Chorus]
I'm looking for a lost boy caught up in the haze
Searching night and day for you
Cause I'm lost boy while you slip away
Can't you see I'm sleeping too?
When you're gone, gone
When you're gone, gone
I can't, I can't hold on
When you're goneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
