Song title: Another Love

[Verse 1]
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hands been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up
[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up

[Bridge]
(Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of)
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up, up122EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Heal

[Verse 1]
Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

[Verse 2]
Take my past and take my sins
Like an empty sail takes the wind
And heal, heal, heal, heal

[Chorus]
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last

[Verse 3]
Take my heart and take my hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sand
And heal, heal, hell, heal

[Verse 1 (variant)]
Take my mind and take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, hell, heal

[Chorus]
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last
And tell me some things last33EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Half As Good As You

[Verse 1: Tom Odell & Alice Merton]
I'm sick to death of eating breakfast on my own
Starting out my daily blues
(Hmmm)
I'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone
(Oh)
Scrolling through pictures of you
I'd like to say that maybe we could work it out
But I know that it's no use

[Chorus: Tom Odell & Alice Merton]
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that would do
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Alice Merton & Both]
I kissed a stranger in the hallway late last night
He was wearing purple shoes
I asked him when he kissed me, could he close his eyes?
But he just looked at me confused (Oh)
And people say my expectations are too high
But I'm not asking for the moon

[Chorus: Alice Merton & Both]
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that would do (Ooh, ooh)
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that would do
[Bridge: Tom Odell, Alice Merton & Both]
Oh, I'm so sick of laying here
So sick of counting tears
Comparing everyone to you
Oh, oh
Oh, I'm so sick of waiting here
So frustrated
My suspicions are you're laying there and thinking of me too

[Verse 3: Tom Odell, Alice Merton & Both]
I learned the lyrics yesterday to all your songs
There was one I couldn't do
I think the lyric went
"You'll miss me when I'm gone"
But the chords, I was confused
I'd ask you 'round and you could tell me where I'm wrong
But then I know you'd just refuse
Refuse

[Chorus: Tom Odell & Both]
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that would do
Oh, oh
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
I think maybe that would do7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Concrete

[Verse 1]
Got me in my hotel room
More pillows I could ever use
Think they call it luxury
But it doesn't make a difference to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
Just the two of us and no sheet
Just your feet rubbing up against mine

[Verse 2]
Staring at the picture on the wall
Yeah it's pretty clever, but it's got no soul
Show me your masterpiece
And it wouldn't make a difference to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
Just the two of us and no sheet
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
Oh rubbing up against mine
Oh rubbing up against mine
Oh rubbing up against mine

[Bridge]
I sit on these aeroplanes
But I just wanna walk
Play me these symphonies
But I just wanna talk
So babe won't you come back
Oh I need something real
[Chorus]
I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
Just the two of us and no sheets
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
Well, I'd sleep on a bed that's made of concrete
Just the two of us and no sheet
Just your feet rubbing up against mine
Oh rubbing up against mine
Oh rubbing up against mine
Rubbing up against mine
Rubbing up against mine6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Magnetised

[Verse 1]
See those birds going across the sky
Three thousand miles they fly
How do they know which way to go?
Somehow they always seem to know
They say there's mother nature in everything we see
Wish I had a little mother nature in me
Wish I had a little mother nature in me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralysed, she's never gonna need me
But sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky

[Chorus]
She'll keep me hanging on
She keep me hanging on

[Verse 2]
See the couple lying on the bus
Falling asleep with so much trust
I wish I had a chance to let them know
Their love is like a flower in the snow
If it's just pheromones then that may be
I wish you had a little pheromones for me
I wish you had a little pheromones for me
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralysed, I know you're never gonna need me
I'm sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky

[Chorus]
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)

[Bridge]
North to south, white to black
When you love someone that don't love you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Yea, it's not right, I'm magnetised
To somebody that don't feel it
Love paralysed, she's never gonna need me
But sure as the world keeps the moon in the sky

[Chorus]
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She'll keep me hanging on (Keep me hanging on)
She'll keep me hanging on11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Grow Old with Me

[Verse 1]
I can feel you breathing
With your hair on my skin
As we lie here within, the night
I'll pull the sheets
When it's cold on your feet
'Cause you'll fall back to sleep, every time

[Chorus]
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And oh the best it could be
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
And our hands they might age
And our bodies will change
But we'll still be the same, as we are
We'll still sing our song
When our hair ain't so blonde
And our children have sung, we were right

[Chorus]
They'll sing
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I
[Verse 3]
And the hairs they stand up
And my feet start to thump
Yet the feeling is dreaming, around
You'll be the one
Make me hurt, make me come
Make me feel like I'm real, and alive

(Oh and a one, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I
Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
And all the best it could be
Just you and I15EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Long Way Down

[Verse 1]
Walking on the rooftops
Talking of times
With our eyes a-glowing
Like the city lights
She stands on the ledge
She says, "It looks so high"

[Pre-Chorus]
You know it's a

Long way down
Feels like a long way down
It feels like a long way down
Like a long way down
Oh, honey, don't leave, don't leave
Please, don't leave me now

'Cause I can feel the rivers
Winding through the lands
Two lines, and a poet
You know, like a kind old rye
You know we could talk in that language
Only we understand
[Pre-Chorus]
But you know, honey, it's a

Long way down
You know love, is a long way down
It feels like a long way down
Oh, it feels like a long way down

Song title: If You Wanna Love Somebody

[Verse 1]
You should look at your reflection
If you wanna see a lie
You're heading in the right direction
If you wanna pick a side
Give me more perfection if you wanna see me cry

[Chorus]
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
I'm your guy
I'm your guy

[Verse 2]
You should get your car a starting
If you wanna be apart
Go to the Californian party
If you wanna fuck a star
Or flick back through your memories
If you want a broken heart

[Chorus]
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody
(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody

If you wanna just pretend
You gotta make your kiss a little colder
If it's ever gonna end
Lay your head upon my shoulder if you just need a friend

(If you want to love)
Oh, if you wanna love somebody

You wanna be back in love
Do you wanna be back in love?

You've gotta know that by now

Song title: Wrong Crowd

[Verse 1]
And my mother is standing beside me
As I'm packing my bags in the car
She says, "Please, boy, no more fighting
Oh, it's only gonna do you harm"

[Chorus]
But I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round
With the wrong crowd
I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd
(Ohhhh)
My boy

[Verse 2]
And my brother is standing behind me
As I'm slowly going out my head
He says, "You know those people don't like me
Why'd you wanna be one of them?"

[Chorus]
But I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd
I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd
[Bridge]
I wish I could find somebody
Ohhh, That my mother would like
Oooooh, I wish I can find somebody
That could treat me right

[Chorus]
But I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd
I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd

Singing, I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd
Thinking, I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd

I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd
Thinking, I can't help it, I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging 'round
With the wrong crowd17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
