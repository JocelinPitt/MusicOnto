Song title: Best Part

[Intro: H.E.R.]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1: H.E.R.]
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R.]
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Daniel Caesar]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it, I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow, no matter how far
If life is a movie, know you're the best part, ooh
You're the best part, ooh
Best part
[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love (Make love)
It makes me feel so nice

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it, I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow, no matter how far
If life is a movie, then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Outro: Daniel Caesar & H.E.R.]
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?
Love me, won't you?
If you love me, won't you say something?
If you love me, won't you?

Song title: Get You

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be callin'
None of that could ever make me leave

You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

Your cries, they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need between those thighs

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, babe

And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories
Now

[Bridge: Daniel Caesar]
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I takeâ€”

Song title: Blessed

[Verse 1]
Everywhere that I go, everywhere that I be
If you were not surrounding me with your energy
I don't wanna be there, don't wanna be anywhere
Anyplace that I can't feel you, I just wanna be near you

[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could, I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Verse 2]
It's the things that you say
It's the way that you prey
Prey on my insecurities
I know you're feelin' me
I know sometimes I do wrong
But hear the words of this song
When I go, I don't stay gone for long
Don't know what's going on
[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could, I swear I'd go back
Make everything all better, whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm coming back home to you
And I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
I'm coming back home to you
I'm coming back home
[Chorus]
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
Sometimes it gets unhealthy
We can't be by ourselves, we
Will always need each other
And yes, I'm a mess but I'm blessed
To be stuck with you
I just want you to know that
If I could, I swear I'll go back
Make everything all better, whoa19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Streetcar

[Verse]
Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know

[Chorus]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there

[Post-Chorus]
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

[Chorus]
Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
All these street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, I'm just not there
[Post-Chorus]
In these streets
In these streets
I'm just not there in these streets
I'm just not there
Life just ain't fair

[Outro]
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
I don't know what else to say
The good Lord gives
The good Lord taketh away
That's how it goes
Don't go live your life in vain19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Who Hurt You?

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Take me back to Georgia, back to Atlanta
Funny how present turns past
I might fly Priscilla out just for 'Bana
So mesmerized by that ass
The way she moves it I can tell that she loves me
Nigga can't help but to touch
Smack it 'round a bit then sip on some bubbly
Hope I'm not doing too much

[Refrain: Daniel Caesar]
Strange new addictions picked up on the road
Changed my opinions and changed up my flows
Changed my approach, no more loving these hoes
And when it rains it pours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
You make me feel so primal and
That's what I am, I'm just a man

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & T-Pain]
Take that pussy, drop it in my lap
I love it when you move like that
Now turn around and throw it back, it back, it back (I'm just a man)
Oh-no-no-no-no-oh-oh
[Verse 2: T-Pain & Daniel Caesar with T-Pain]
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew
Strippers out in Vegas, New Orleans too
Booties just don't shake like Priscilla's do
Follies on a Tuesday, not one but two
Not one stack or two
Look at all the cash I blew

[Refrain: Daniel Caesar, T-Pain, & Both]
Strange new addictions picked up on the road (Oh, up on the road)
Changed my opinions and changed up my flows (Oh, up my flows)
Changed my approach, no more loving these hoes (Changed my approach, loving these hoes)
And when it rains it pours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
You make me feel, yes, so primal and
That's what I am, I'm just a man

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Take that pussy, drop it in my lap
I love it when you move like that
Now turn around and throw it back, it back, it back26EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: We Find Love

[Verse 1]
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
See you walking out that door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song

[Chorus]
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up

[Verse 2]
You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
You need someone you adore
Find a place where you might belong
Ever since the day that I met you
My world's been spinnin' out of control
I just need you to hold
[Bridge]
We knew it'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
We knew it'd come around (We find love)
This thing called love comes crashing down, ahh (We get up)
Pieces all on the ground (Then we fall down)
What once was lost cannot be found, ahh (We give up)
Heaven help us, heaven help us, yeah
We're on our own

[Chorus]
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
Then we fall down, we give up
We find love, yeah, we get up
We fall down, we give up31EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Hold Me Down

[Intro]
Could you, could you say, "I love you, Danny"?
You want me to?
Could you?
I love you, Danny
[Chorus]
If you love me, baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me in the basement
I know I'm your favorite
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me on the pavement
I know I'm your favorite

[Verse]
I got this girl, she's making me crazy
I nearly let her have all my babies
Pussy so good, it sets me on fire
I leave myself, I elevate higher
You're fly girl, but you're headed to maybe
I'll take the time, treat you like a lady, yeah
My life's a spectacle, a sad story
Perhaps I'll find my way to the glory, yes
[Pre-Chorus]
Iâ€™m the one that took you to higher heights
That's what I was trying to do
I know you had your dreams of a better life
This time we ain't making it through

[Chorus]
If you love me, baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me in the basement
I know I'm your favorite
If you love me baby let me hear you say it
I know I'm your favorite
First you love me then you leave me on the pavement
I know I'm your favorite

[Bridge]
You're getting on a plane
And travelling far away
You've left me with a pain
I carry it everyday
Who do you think you are
Some kind of celebrity?
Just wait and see

[Outro]
I never asked for much only that you stay true
Need I remind you all the things I do for you?
Who can I blame, I played the game
Well just for now
I was wondering can you hold me down?
I was wondering can you hold me down?20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Freudian

[Part I]

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
You are the reason
The reason I sing
I have to preserve you
'Cause you're my everything
Babe, I know I fucked up
Fucked with some empty cups
But you got your friends too
Better believe in it
Truth I'm up on my luck
Can't stop runnin' amok
But you got your friends too

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
I just want to thank you for savin' my life, yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
You are the reason (Ooh), the reason I'm alive
I must bring you honor (Honor)
If I don't, I'll die
Ma', I know I brought shame (Ma', I know I brought shame)
Put a mark on your name (Put a mark on your name)
But you got your thangs too (You got your thangs too)
Better believe it, I'm (You got your thangs too)
Risin' up from the flames (Risin' up from the flames)
The phoenix that I became (The phoenix that I became)
But you got your thangs too (You got your thangs)
Oh, help me sing
[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & Choir]
I just want to thank you for givin' me life, yes
I just want to thank you for all your advice

[Bridge: Choir & Daniel Caesar]
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
Its been so long, look how time flies
If you love me, won't you let me know?
I've been tryna learn to let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
When you face your fears, you'll stand tall, ohh, whoa
Send me kisses when it's grey skies
(Can't you see?)
Its been so long, look how time flies
(I'm spending all)
If you love me, won't you let me know?
(This time)
I've been tryna learn to let you go
Call my name whenever tears fall
(Come with me)
When you face your fears, you'll stand tall, ohh, whoa
(I hope we can)
(Rewind)

[Verse 3: Daniel Caesar]
Know I'd take a bullet for you
No, you don't know what I go through
And I know you think you're kind of nice
Do you remember when I saved your life?
Don't come at me on some weak shit
It's time you stopped displaying weakness, ohh, ohh
[Outro: Sean Leon]
Hey mama
It's your second son, still the same, ain't changed, mama
Made some change
Times have changed on me
Times have changed (Minds have changed)
And mine feels strange, mama
I feel ashamed (What could I say to you face to face with my fate, I lost my faith)
Face to face with my fate, mama, I lost my faith

[Silent Interlude]
[Part II]
[Verse: Daniel Caesar]
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice
The universe got it
I got too excited
And now we're taking life
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice
I hate consequences, that shit's too expensive
You keep chasing delight
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice
I take the easy way out every time
I don't deserve my own life
Isn't it nice?
Human sacrifice, oh yes
They say I'm a martyr
Charge that to my ego
I just want all the lights14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
