Song title: Precious Possession

[Intro]
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand

[Refrain]
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand

[Verse 1]
Blank slate big smile
Nice pout long hair
Toned thighs big legs
Both breasts blank stare
We've learned that this is what you want
We can't erase what we've been taught
Will you call me your girlfriend
I wanna be your princess
Will you call me your girlfriend
I wanna be your princess

[Chorus]
Come down on me
I am your precious possession
I'm so delicate
I need your protection
[Verse 2]
Clothes in front of your new daddy
Stick my ass out for all it's worth
Stay like this until the grave daddy
Drop your ass, what's your self esteem worth?

[Refrain]
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand
Hold me close I'm wasting away
Hold me close I'm too fucked to stand

[Outro]
I'm addicted to myself
I'm addicted to my wealth
I'm lying to myself
(I am your precious possession)
Lying to myself
Put your hands on my face
Put your hands on my waist
Put your hands on my face
(I need your protection)
I'm addicted to myself
I'm addicted to my wealth
I'm lying to myself
(I am your precious possession)
Lying to myself
Put your hands on my face
Put your hands on my waist
Put your hands on my face
(I need your protection)
I'm addicted to myself
I'm addicted to my wealth
I'm lying to myself
(I am your precious possession)
Lying to myself
Put your hands on my face
Put your hands on my waist
Put your hands on my face
(I need your protection)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: BitchSlut

[Verse 1]
So they're calling you a bitch, calling you a slut
Cause you dressed up, cause you dressed down
Cause you said no, cause you slept 'round
Cause you played games, cause you lost your head
Cause you went slow, cause you jumped ahead
Cause your hair's long, cause you shaved it off
Cause you did wrong, can't erase it, tough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause beauty is fleeting, all an opinion
Cause you felt pretty when you attracted your minions
Cause people are seeing what they wanna see
The mirror of reflections to see who's to beat
But it's all a deflection

[Chorus]
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut
[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the street with my hands tied
Cause I wore a skirt, you think I'm down to ride
You think I wanna fuck cause I comb my hair
Cause I'm at the bar next to an open chair
Cause I always have to be polite
Cause I look you in the eye
Cause I grin back, green light
Go ahead, give it a try

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know there are people who like the attention
I know admiration is a kind of affection
But I'm more into the heart of a person
The day I follow fleeting is the day I'll be hurting
Yes, I'm into attention

[Chorus]
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut
I, I know what kind you are
If I say no, I'm a bitch
Say yes I'm a slut, say yes I'm a slut2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Go

[Verse 1]
Took me for a ride, all your lies, all the ego
Had to let it go
Now all you say, is "Baby stay, I'm available"
Had to let it go
Not this old fight on your wedding night
You already know I have to let you go
So put away your sorry face I'll be on my way
Time for me to go

[Verse 2]
But I never wanna go it alone
All the seagulls circlin' round it's on!
This whole time I thought it was you, it's me
Meet me after dark in the trees, redo
Up the tension biting my tongue no more
Cuz I'll never be this young again

[Chorus]
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it
[Verse 3]
All up hill from here the atmosphere of your circle
Had to let you go
Used to fall, then you'd stall, made me feel small
Had to let you go
No dancing days knew your toxic ways couldn't help me grow
Had to let you go
I know that I will come out alive without you by my side
So I'm letting go

[Verse 4]
But I never wanna go it alone
All the seagulls circlin' round it's on!
No new friends to come back to this time
Got this tune for when it gets bad, withdrawl
Cut the tension biting my tongue no more
Cuz I'll never feel this low again

[Chorus]
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it

I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
I used to love it
I used to love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it
But you still love it
But you still love it, love it

[Outro]
They used to, oh
I used to love it
But you still love
But you stillEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Decrease My Waist, Increase My Wage

[Verse 1]
I spot a breakup
I spot a make up
And then I hit my vapor
Tryna get this paper
The world is turning
Ooh, my eyes are burning
I see all that I'm learning
But what about my earnings?

[Pre-Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Chorus]
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me is

[Verse 2]
I'm with my girlfriends
And they got girlfriends
You like to talk about us
But you don't ever speak to us
I'll tell ya straight up
We're all a little messed up
I see you filling yours up
So put a little in my cup
[Pre-Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Chorus]
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me is

[Pre-Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Chorus]
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me

[Bridge]
Everybody talking' 'bout a new generation
Everybody talkin' like they the one
Why can't we all grow together?
Why can't we all be as one?
[Verse 3]
Separatin', lady-hatin', coughin' up for education
Stiflin' imagination, side eye to our liberation
Heavy hitters sellin' sex, hungry for who's comin' next
We still here, did you forget?
We still here, did you forget?

[Pre-Chorus]
Decrease my waist, increase my wage
Decrease my waist, increase my wage

[Chorus]
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me
All ya sayin', all ya sayin'
All ya sayin' to me

[Outro]
They try to break us up
They try to break us up
Try to break us up
Try to break us up
They try to break us up
They try to break us up
Try to break us up
Try to break us up
They try to break us up
They try to break us up
Try to break us up
Try to break us upEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Some Mistakes

Taking shots and I can feel it
See my heart it breaks
I was blind to
All the ways you take
I couldn't wait for you to make the mistake
Oh, it's too late for

(I knew you were gonna break my heart)

Taking shots and I can feel it
See my heart it breaks
I was blind to
All the ways you take
I couldn't wait for you to make the mistake
Oh, it's too late for
You to make it up when you made it up

I don't mind making some mistakes
When I know it's all for the best
(Taking shots and I can feel it)
I don't mind making some mistakes
When I know it's all for the best

See my heart it breaks
I was blind to
All the ways you take
I couldn't wait for you to make the mistake
Oh, it's too late for
You to make it up when you made it up
I don't mind making some mistakes
When I know it's all for the best
I don't mind making some mistakes
When I know it's all for the bestEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Abracadabra

[Verse 1: Anna Wise]
I wanted to believe you
But I was unsure, so I moved slow up the ladder
I was careful‚ but it didn't matter
'Cause you got what you wanted: a feeling
When I said you could hold me and feel lucky
And we basked in our mutual adoring
And I don't show this side of me to no one
Maybe‚ you do this kind of thing all the time
How could you change so suddenly?
How could you desire me‚ then have no desire left for me? (Love yourself)
Please (Love yourself)
Say to me: what you want? What you need?
(Love yourself, love yourself)
Please, explain yourself

[Verse 2: Little Simz & Anna Wise]
Yo
The story of never ending
Empty bottles and ashtrays
Overdosing on lies prescribed to me by my cellmate
So to speak
Do you even notice me?
Almost had control of me
I let you into my galaxy
How our world so obsolete
Nothing ever feels complete
A victim of disbelief
Honest is what you've never been
Why the ones that close to me?
Why has God done chosen me?
Money doesn't grow on trees
My riches‚ my soul at peace
I wanted to believe you
I wanted to keep you
Forgive me if that's selfish
I'm thinking of me, too
Had a shitty deck of cards
And I dealt with it calm
Shoulda knew this shit would fade, like the tats in your palm
You gotta laugh
Am I a fool 'cause I fell for your charm
And those beautiful eyes?
You're a beautiful liar
And a fake in disguise
Show your colors with pride
It's approaching that time
Let us all see your light
Let us all see your light (Love yourself)
[Bridge: Little Simz & Anna Wise]
Made me wait
A fire brewin' in my heart today (Please)
And it sounds like (Love yourself)
Say to me‚ oh what you want? Oh what you need? (Love yourself)
Abracadabra, yeah, you got me
The trickster, I'll never close my eyes again

[Outro: Anna Wise]
Love yourself
Love yourself
Love yourself
Love yourself

Song title: Coconuts

It's a matter of opinion
When it comes to what you're thinking of me
Everything is beautiful and ugly
At the same time it's all how you see

Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh

I can feel the distance
Growing between what you're told and what you're thinking
All the governors of status
Quo know that they're old that ship is sinking
Go for it you know when we're together
Baby there's nothing that we can't do
So ignore their disapproval
Let's go for the free and novel me and you

Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Count My Blessings

[Intro: Anna Wise]
See it, get it
If you can see it
Get it
If you can see it, then you know that you can get it on the way
If you can see it, on the way
Then you know that you can get it, on the way
If you can see it, on the way
Then you know that you can get it, on the way
If you can see it, on the way
Then you know that you can get it, on the way
If you can see it, on the way
Then you know that you can get it, on the way
See it, get it

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
As the world spins around me like I'm utilizing vinyl
My final destination are behind me like a spinal
Tapped into my psyche
Manifesting someone like me
Walking to the grocery store end up bumpin' into my wifey
Right up out my fantasies
Stay up here one advantage
I organize my thoughts and it seems I'm losing my sanity
Rambling 'bout when I'm my best whenever I'm gamblin'
Manifestin' most of my money in palms, handlin'
Channeling my inner self with my inner self
So it's two times deeper, beyond things that I've felt
If I felt, I feel
If I dealt, I deal
Given my ideals
Now I got what's real
Tangible, not mechanical
Caging my inner animal
Minutes eating up most of my time
The clock is a cannibal
Yet, there's other answers
Manifest the message
When there's nothing to count on
I'm counting all of my blessings
I'm out
[Bridge: Anna Wise]
On the way, on the way
I must draw it out from where it hides
If you can see it, on the way
Then you know that you can get it, on the way
If you can see it, on the way
I must draw it out from where it hides
If you can see it, on the way
Then you know that you can get it, on the way
If you can see it, on the way
I must draw it out from where it hides

[Outro: Anna Wise]
On the way, on the way
On the way, on the way
On the way, on the way
On the way, on the wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Nerve

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna take the safe side
Feeling all of my pride fading
Steady reaching for a moment
Where I'm feeling like I'm fully in it

I'm not gonna play the safe side
Feeling all of my pride fading
(Lately I've been being selfish but)
Steady reaching for a moment
Feeling like I'm fully in it
(Moving past that old shit work it)

[Chorus]
Almost done settled down
You were sewn in on my left side
With a pin in my eye like a voodoo needle
Almost done, not my style
How can you live in a love denial
When you know what it is

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna live a simple life
When I'm not a simple woman
(Lately I've been somewhat reckless but)
I'm just trying to live my best life
No, I never meant to hurt you
(But I got to do this for me)
[Chorus]
Almost done settled down
You were sewn in on my left side
With a pin in my eye like a voodoo needle
Almost done, not my style
How can you live in a love denial
When you knew what it was

[Outro]
You knew what it was
You knew what it was
You knew what it wasEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
