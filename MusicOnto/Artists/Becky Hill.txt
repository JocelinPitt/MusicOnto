Song title: Last Time

[Verse 1]
Baby, now you're back again
Back into my life
Hit a lot of turbulence, you know
One too many arguments
I have to let go, forgive you, I know
You say you wanna try
And I see you change before my eyes into somebody new
So, no empty promises
I need to know it's worth it if I'm gonna go there with you

[Chorus]
This is the last time, now you're mine
The last time falling in love
After the last fight, I realised
I'm not giving you up
The first time we broke, you left in the night
This time, we're getting it right
This is the last timе, now you're mine
The last timе falling in love (In love, in love)

[Drop]
The last time falling in love

[Verse 2]
You know it's been hard for me
I still got my fears
Couple insecurities, deep down
But I'ma give you all of me
Give you my best, all this beautiful mess
[Chorus]
This is the last time, now you're mine
The last time falling in love
After the last fight, I realised
I'm not giving you up
The first time we broke, you left in the night
This time, we're getting it right
This is the last time, now you're mine
The last time falling in love

[Drop]
The last time falling in love

[Bridge]
No more tears up in my eyes
Wondering where you were last night
No more stressing 'bout who's on your mind
Said we'd give it one last try
Try to stay for life, for life

[Chorus]
This is the last time, now you're mine
The last time falling in love
After the last fight, I realised
I'm not giving you up
The first time we broke, you left in the night
This time, we're getting it right
This is the last time, now you're mine
The last time falling in love (In love, in love)
[Drop]
The last time falling in loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Back To My Love

[Verse 1: Becky Hill]
Had to hide myself away
Had to get it down on paper
Kept making the same mistakes
Maybe it's just in my nature
Trust me, I know how it looks
You know I don't give a fuck
Don't feel sorry for me
But if I have time to breathe
I start to think of what I'm missing

[Chorus: Becky Hill]
Back to my love
Got to know me before I know what I want
I'm back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome
Oh, just a few things I gotta overcome
Back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome
Back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome

[Verse 2: Becky Hill]
It doesn't really bother me
Just as long as I'm kept busy
I wouldn't say that I'm lonely
Just as long as I'm in company
I just need a little time
I promise you that I'm just fine
Don't feel sorry for me
But if I have space to think (space to think)
I start to notice what I'm missing
[Chorus: Becky Hill]
Back to my love
Got to know me before I know what I want
I'm back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome
Ohhh, just a few things I gotta overcome
Back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome
Back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome

[Bridge: Becky Hill]
Can't be two if you've never been one
If you've never been one, if you've never been one
Can't be two if you've never been one
If you've never been one, if you've never been one

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
Oh, how could Simz ever be two?
I'm as unique as it gets man, how could Simz ever be you?
Hella staring when they see me, haven't you ever seen truth?
Might have been sent here only for you to admire this view
As you should, I been so misunderstood
I got space tomorrow, would stay there for good
If I could, if I lead, will you follow?
We just  might get lost, but so what?
Start to think outside the box
Ain't not limits where I'm from
I just gotta get back...
[Chorus: Becky Hill]
Back to my love
Got to know me before I know what I want
I'm back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome
Oh, just a few things I gotta overcome
(Got to overcome, got to, got to get back)
Just a few things I gotta overcome
Back to my love
Just a few things I gotta overcome

[Outro: Becky Hill]
Got to  get back, got to overcome, got to1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Warm

[Intro]
(Warm)
(Warm)

[Verse 1]
Never felt like this before
Got them, grey clouds hanging over me
Got caught up in the downpour
Need an umbrella to get underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I don't know what's meant for me
'Cause me and you haven't spoken in several weeks
You should know that I'm gonna play for keeps
Just need to weather the storm

[Chorus]
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm

[Verse 2]
Swept away by this whirlwind
As the ground turns to dust
Fate turns as we meet again
And the like turns to lust
[Pre-Chorus]
But maybe I just know what's meant for me
'Cause me and you haven't spoken in several weeks
Should know that if this was meant to be
You should let it be known

[Chorus]
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm

[Vocal bridge]
Warm, warm
Warm, warm
Warm, warm
What's like to feel warm

[Chorus]
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like to feel warm
Behind grey clouds is blue skies and sunrise, oh-oh
And God knows I have tried to visualize what it's like, what it's like, oh

[Outro]
Warm (warm), warm (warm, warm)
Warm (warm, warm), oh
What it's like to feel warm
(Warm, warm), warm
(Warm, warm), warm
(Warm, warm), oh-oh
(What's it's like) to feel warm3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Forever Young

[Verse 1]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into thе sun
Praising our leaders, we'rе getting in tune
The music's played by the, the madman

[Chorus]
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
And ever, and ever
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
And ever, forever young

[Verse 2]
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
Oh, It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
Oh let them come true
[Chorus]
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Oh
Do you really want to live forever
And ever, and ever?
Forever young
I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever youngEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Sunrise in the East

[Verse 1]
Couple more minutes, couple more hours
This conversation
Tell me your secrets, tell me your powers
Can we be patient?
It's getting late, but what does it matter?
We can just lay here
We can just stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that there's doubts, still they run through your mind
Then why don't we put 'em to bed tonight?
I fall into your honesty

[Chorus]
So we talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Tell me how you're happy, tell me why you're afraid
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Now we got each other, hope it's always this way
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east

[Verse 2]
The curtains don't open until the evening, never time wasted
Sunlight can wait when it's you I'm facing
Can we be safe here?
Gone are the days when I can be vacant
Now that we've made it
Let us be sacred
[Pre-Chorus]
Just let go of insecurity
You'll never know
You're always more to me
I fall into your honesty

[Chorus]
So we can talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Now we got each other, hope it's always this way
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east
'Cause we talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Tell me how you're happy, tell me why you're afraid
We can build our trust beneath the sheets (sheets)
Talk until the sunrise in the east
I'm hanging on to every single word that you say
Now we got each other, hope it's always this way
We can build our trust beneath the sheets
Talk until the sunrise in the east
Talk until the sunrise in the east1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Space

[Verse 1]
It's like we're only honest on the weekend
Only when we're out our minds
Now we're trying to swim in the deep end
Different people, different times

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You got troubles with your mother
Then you make me suffer
Mistakes I haven't made
And I got problems with my father
It's hard to love another without being afraid

[Chorus]
Well, maybe we need space, space
Well, maybe we need space, space

[Verse 2]
I thought it would take a conversation
But now we've spent a week apart
It feels like we're losing our patience
Trying to find each other in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You brush mountains under carpets
Hoping it's forgotten until another day
And I just wanna talk it over
Tryna pull us closer
But you just run away
[Chorus]
Well, maybe we need space, space
Well, maybe we need space, space

[Bridge]
In the distance, in between us
We can find our way home
And if you want to be how it used to
We just need some time alone
Oh

[Pre-Chorus 3]
You got troubles with your mother
Then you make me suffer
Mistakes I haven't made
And I just wanna talk it over
Tryna pull us closer
But you just run away

[Chorus]
Well, maybe we need space, space
Well, maybe we need space, space
Well, maybe we need
(Maybe we need, maybe we need)
Space
Space
Space
[Outro]
It's like we're only honest on the weekend
And now we're running out of time2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Changing

[Snippet]
Circles start then have no end
I chase my tail to who knows where, I don't know
Cause I got my hands out in the dark, trying to talk to God
Wondering if she forgot I'm here, I'm feeling scared
Questions everywhere, everybody wants an answer

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows what is wrong or right, wish I could see it all clearer
And I don't even recognise whose starring back in the mirror

[Chorus]
Cause I'm still holding on to my mistakes
Walls are closing in, I have no space
Funny that I'm stuck in my old ways
While everything's changing
I'm still waking up when night begins
Need to wash away all of my sin
Finding out I'm so hard to convince while everything's changing
While everything's changing , while everything's changing
While everything's changing , while everything's changing

[Verse 2]
The ground moves underneath my feet
Stumble and fall, I feel defeat, I can't go
Because I got my hands out in the dark, trying to talk to God
Wondering if she forgot I'm here, I'm feeling scared
Questions everywhere, everybody wants an answer
[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows what is wrong or right, wish I could see it all clearer
And I don't even recognise whose starring back in the mirror

[Chorus]
Cause I'm still holding on to my mistakes
Walls are closing in, I have no space
Funny that I'm stuck in my old ways
While everything's changing
I'm still waking up when night begins
Need to wash away all of my sin
Finding out I'm so hard to convince while everything's changing
While everything's changing , while everything's changing
While everything's changing , while everything's changing
While everything's changing , while everything's changingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Caution to the Wind

[Produced by Two Inch Punch]

[Verse 1]
I wear my heart on my sleeve
But not for show
And I find it hard not to leave
And let go
I don't know when to bite my tongue
The words just kind of flow
And I suppose I'm only young
I've got room to grow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll cut to the chase
I'm finding my feet
In this rat race
I'm just tryna succeed

[Chorus]
I'm gonna throw caution to the wind
I'm gonna stand alone
And come hell or high water
I wanna stay afloat
I'm gonna go the extra mile
This time
I'm gonna throw caution to the wind
I'm gonna stand alone, I'm gonna stand alone
[Verse 2]
Getting to know the ropes
Learning on the job
And even with these high hopes
It's hard not to stop
And if you lend me your ear
I swear
You won't have to knock on wood
Don't dispair

[Pre-Chorus]

Song title: Rude Love

[Verse 1]
Every time I call you on the phone
You're with your new girl, what's the deal with that?
What about me and what I want?
Can't take it, I need your affection

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't show me no love anymore
I've had enough dancing on my own
You don't show me no love anymore, love anymore

[Chorus]
Rude love
Rude love

[Verse 2]
Reminiscing of the days but the memories fade
You're a stranger, can hardly recognize your face
It's like everything we had just didn't mean a thing
Didn't mean a thing, didn't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you don't show me no love anymore
I've really had enough dancing on my own
You don't show me no love anymore, love anymore
[Chorus]
Rude love
Rude love
Love
Rude love
(You don't show me) Love
(You just show me) Rude love
(You don't show me) Love
(You don't show me)

[Bridge]
Tell me how I'm supposed to know
When you keep blowing hot and cold?
I just don't get enough
It's just too rude, this love
And I fear that it's gonna grow

[Break]
(This rude love)
You don't show me no love anymore, you know
All you show me is rude love, rude love
(You don't show me)
You don't show me no love anymore, you know
All you show me is rude love, rude love
(You don't show me)
You don't show me no love anymore, you know
(You just show me)
All you show me is rude love, rude love
(Rude love)
You don't show me no love anymore, you know
(You don't show me, no, you don't show, you know)
All you show me is rude love
[Chorus]
You don't show me (You show me)
You just show me rude love (Oh)
You don't show me (You show me)
You just show me rude love
You don't show me (Rude love)
You just show me rude love
You don't show me (Rude love)
You just shoe me rude love1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Unpredictable

[Verse 1]
I believe that we all have a chance
I believe that love will grow
And in time we'll stand in fields of gold
From the seeds that we have sown
You can find me when you think you're lost
And it can lead you home
But it'll find you when it's ready, yeah
Love is unpredictable

[Chorus]
Love is unpredictable
Oh, love is unpredictable

[Post-Chorus]
Unpredictable
Love is...
Love is unpredictable

[Verse 2]
I believe there's someone right for me (right for me)
If I stop holding on too tight
Tryna find a face to recognize
But that will only come with time (time)
So I'll pretend that it don't bother me (I'll pretend)
And I won't ask for nothing more
I'll leave it up to chance
'Cause it's not in my hands
Love is unpredictable
[Chorus]
Love, love is unpredictable
Oh, love is unpredictable

[Post-Chorus]
Unpredictable
Love is unpredictable

[Bridge]
When it comes alone
There will be a warning
If you keep the faith
It will lead your way to love
Love
Love is unpredictable

[Chorus]
Love, love is unpredictable
Love, love is unpredictable
Love, love is
Love, love
Love is, love
Love is unpredictable
