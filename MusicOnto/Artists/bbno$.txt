Song title: ​edamame

[Chorus: bbno$ & Rich Brian]
Balls hanging low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swanging, cling-clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Bad-ass B, keep on going 'til you hit the spot
Woah, I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 1: Rich Brian &  bbno$]
Just popped her kidney, I bought a million
Options of the stock and I stopped doin' the green
Man, I rock arenas, bringin' the peace, I'm bumpin' that Pac
In the car, pretendin' I got all the eyes on me
Got a bad baby and she's independent
Too many people older than me that's seekin' attention
When they warned me 'bout the goofies, man, I shoulda listened
And the smell of the money My Strangest Addiction, uh
She tip for dick, I let her lick
I had to dip, I'm off a fifth, am I rich now?
I bought a whip, I paint it pink
It drive itself, the fuck you think? Yeah, I'm rich now

[Pre-Chorus: bbno$]
Ayy, lil' mama, yeah, you heard about me
I'ma pop you like a pea, yeah, edamame
Yeah, feel so hot like I'm chillin' on the beach
Yeah, baby in the sun like the Teletubbies (Woo)
[Chorus: bbno$]
Balls hanging low while I pop a bottle off a yacht
Chain swanging, cling-clang and it cost a lot
Bitch, I'm always after guala, yeah, and you are not
Bad-ass B, keep on going 'til you hit the spot
Woah, I'm a big bag hunter with the bow
She got a big bad dumper, drop it low
Mama called me and she happy with the growth
Never ever fold for a thottie, that's an oath

[Verse 2: Rich Brian & bbno$]
I've been in the club and takin' shots
If you got your mask off in the photo, you getting cropped
Hoppin' out the function, the CVS is like a block away
Bought a moisturizer, my ice cold, it's drying my face
Don't need that VVS, my ice is fake, your life is fake
I choose to do it for my pocket's sake
You basing your opinions on what the major says
I renovate, the bad energy I erase, uh
Yeah, I don't ever really wanna talk, talk, talk, talk
Only really ever want the top, top, top, top
Guess I'm goin' back to the sock, sock, sock, sock
Least this money never really stop, stop, stop, stop

[Pre-Chorus: bbno$]
Ayy, lil' mama, yeah, you heard about me
I'ma pop you like a pea, yeah, edamame
Yeah, feel so hot like I'm chillin' on the beach

Song title: ​go gettas

[Chorus: bbno$]
I'm a go getter, got cheddar
Slice it up and then I put it on the sandy with the bank teller
Swervin' off the Bombay with my dog, ay
101 bitches by my side, what you gon' say?
Tip toe, doin' ballet off my big toe
Never ever gonna say I'm rich, swear I'm rich though
Whoops, I'ma drip 'til I slip
Yeah this thot actin' whack, I'ma snippy-snip-snip

[Verse 1: Killa Fonic]
Un teanc în pantaloni, merg șchiop băi, aye
Cocaina la ciorap pentru ai mei, ay
Nu mai dau de mult, nu mai fur de mult, cioară
M-am jurat că n-o să mai ajung la balamuc, mamă
Ca Glock-u', pă glonț, pe stradă ca pe front
Coaie, pistolu-l folosesc pe un sifon
Fuck you, gang-u' meu rămâne etern mă bro
Pula mea dă tonul, pizda ta cântă Diablo
Trip, trip, bagabonții mei îl cară, bro
Skinny dar car mai mult decât duc io
Prra-prra ratta-ta către o cârpă
Când te fut zâmbesc ca Mona Lisa, târfo
Jakoban te dă cu pizda de pereți, fato
Zero șefi, doar capo lângă capo, coardo
Afiliați cu ăia menționați niciodată
Coarda ta ne suge toți, câte unu' odată
[Chorus: bbno$]
I'm a go getter, got cheddar
Slice it up and then I put it on the sandy with the bank teller

Never ever gonna say I'm rich, swear I'm rich though
Whoops, I'ma drip 'til I slip

[Verse 2: Azteca]
Stai fă, nebuno
Mă vrei, fiindcă-s numero uno
Mi-o iei, spune-mi Papi Chulo
Okay, are o cioată-n gură (Hey!)
Sute de milioane în mână (Woo!)
O să am un Franck Muller (Woo!)
Azteca e numele (Ooh!)
Gata să numere sumele (Ooh!)
Am o pizdă bună, îmi suge sfârcul, eu ei
Încă o pizdă vine: "Geanta aia mi-o iei?"
Vrea un Baby Birkin, eu îi zic okay
Baby, n-am un leu, 's cu baby money, no way
Dacă pizda ar fi un pistol
Te-aș dezarma instant
Constat
Că o fac prea constant (Woo!)
Dacă banii ar fi niște gloanțe
Aș trage în ea instant
Constant
Mi-o linge ca pe blunt

Câți trapperi obosiți fac infarct? (Woah)
De fiecare dată când p-un beat mă cac
Să mă piș pe ei, ia dă-le un colac
Sunt copiii mei toți, bro, i-am botezat
"Mai taci bă-n morții tăi, și tu și hoții tăi, aye"
De piese clout, haine de purtat (Swag)
Fii și tu băiat, ia mai dă-te-n asfalt (Coaie)
Trapere, vezi c-am mașina ta la gât
Niște bighidii așteaptă să ți-o dea urât
Ia la țăranu' ăsta, nu-i din București
Cu o pizdă cu care nu ai curaj să vorbești (Coaie)
Vezi c-ai datorie în picioare (Cash)
Eu investesc în continuare (Prr, prr)

Song title: ​slop

[Chorus]
I fight like anaconda, why you tryna buck up?
My money got way longer, do you need a close-up?
I'll place another comma, yeah, I always round up
My dick game cause a trauma, yeah, she want the hook-up

[Post-Chorus]
I’m quite a G, so I made her nut
There's one, two, three, girlies tryna suck
You is a flea, nothing but a schmuck
Got a degree and I'm just warmin’ up

[Verse 1]
Yeah, 3-7-5, hot boy, you should keep your space
Coochie let me dive, way too big, wait, there ain't no space
Baby doin' five, sprintin' for the money, check my pace
Mommies on my line, let me tell her, "I just want the face"
Y equals MX plus B minus E, I want slop (Slop)
M-Make a couple hits, chop-chop
Finally, crush my crush, I ain't talkin' 'bout pop, yeah
Ballet on my clothes, and I didn't have to shop

[Refrain]
I might find myself through contemplation, ha
I might find my downfall from frustration, ha
[Chorus]
I fight like anaconda, why you tryna buck up?
My money got way longer, do you need a close-up?
I’ll place another comma, yeah, I always round up
My dick game cause a trauma, yeah, she want the hook-up

[Verse 2]
But I’m cold and I'm hot, and that’s probably why she topped
I was told that I pop and these labels gettin' blocked
Your shit old, I'm on top, and I'm sorry that you flopped
Take a photo like a thot, and your shorty gettin’ cropped
Thick chick, feel slick, want my energy, huh
Short dick, bust quick, mockumentary, huh
Lipstick, picnic, honeys out on me, huh
Big stick, Nerf clip, I'ma let it scream

[Refrain]
I might find myself through contemplation, ha
I might find my downfall from frustration, ha
I might find myself through contemplation, ha
I might find my downfall from frustration, ha

Song title: ​bad thoughts

[Verse 1]
Baby no accomplice, every man for himself
Tryna get my money, yeah, I'm really 'bout my wealth
Pull up swingin' on me, can't you see I'm black belt
Wonder why I be the only rapper 'bout my health
If I'm not grindin', might as well put me in hell
Labels chasin' me 'cause I deactivated stealth
Fuckin' hated school, I was saved by the bell
Ain't so different from you, yeah, why can't you tell?

[Refrain]
Cash in, cash out, consider it dealt
Do this for myself, I ain't do it for the clout
Never copy lanes, yeah, I took another route
Always cause 'grains, never shared a bit of doubt

[Verse 2]
Fill my cup, and I watch you talk shit
Never been an opp, and I've never been a bitch
Be my guest, go burn your own bridge
'Course I'm cold enough, don't need a new fridge
Seems like every song you drop is a miss
Drip too much, yeah, hydrolysis
Really 'bout the cheese, yeah, Armenian Swiss
Get my mom a brand new whip, I'm proud of the gift
Pink-yellow piece of plastic, all up on my hip
Twelve years later, you gon' show me to the kids
Know my music timeless, I don't even need to risk
Once I'm super rich I'll post with diamonds on the bed
I'm always with the flu 'cause I'm ready with the shits
Every song I drop, rare like it's deadstock
Thot girls always puttin' me in an airlock
Finally got some property, cop the boardwalk
Big shows, internationally, even Bangkok
Pop back from China with a big bag
Got some money but I still check the price tag
Numbers movin' slow, so you'll have to blame lag
700k on Spotify, this everyday
Nerf strap, cock back, with a red dot
Won't cap, drawn back, hear a gunshot
Won't relax, no slack, hit the jackpot
Posted at the top, why your bitch be mad, Scott?
[Outro]
Bad thoughts, all I got is bad thoughts
I gotta make sure, they don't break me
Bad thoughts, all I got is bad thoughts
I gotta make sure, they don't break me
Bad thoughts, all I got is bad thoughts
I gotta make sure, they don't break me
Bad thoughts, all I got is bad thoughts
I gotta make sure, they don't break me

Lentra, yah

[Chorus]
She tryna pull a vert on my half pipe, Tony Thot
Money flourish in my bank account and it don't stop
Tryna jugg a piss, got stopped, screw a chick cop
Yo officer, I'm sorry, y'know I'll stop
Sippin' on that Gatorade, you're sippin' on that haterade
I'm tryna get the money so I can make it precipitate
Scribing all these bars, but I mumble when I dictate
I'm postin' with your mami, that's the reason why she was so late

[Verse]
Thottie be so hot, she melt me just like ice
She tryna give me top but I ain't tryna stay the night
'Bout my money, 'bout my cheese though
Roll the bankroll
Call it Play-Doh, I'm a saint though
So I hit it from the back, obtuse, that's an angle
Got a fresh chain silver piece, let it dangle
Dibble dabble little paddle, I'm floating on the lean
My mama always told me, "Yeah, you better eat your beans"
Yeah, I'm really bout my scary movies 'cause I like my freaks
Yeah, my rap game like a mountain and you're barely on the peak
Gang gang, let my chain swang, check my shoe game
You're soggy like a wonton, bitch, where'd you go wrong
Peter Pan, Raf they Stans, girl, you got a mans?
Peter Pan, Peter Xan, I don't fuck with xans
I need some EPO 'cause I don't like cardio
Why she call me daddio?
'Cause she want my lance, oh what?
[Chorus]
She tryna pull a vert on my half pipe, Tony Thot
Money flourish in my bank account and it don't stop
Tryna jugg a piss, got stopped, screw a chick cop
Yo officer, I'm sorry, y'know I'll stop
Sippin' on that Gatorade, you're sippin' on that haterade

Diamonds plastic (What), bag Jurassic
How she work that booty, man she doin' magic, I like had to have it
Life Jurassic, wait
Bitch, I’m the goat (Goat)
Flexing like the pope, I got secrets in my coat, yeah (Uh)
Rubies goin’ through some menopause, you got the POV
Mind on my money, yeah that's a bare necessity (Fur)
Water, water, water, water, water, water, drip
Tater totter, Harry Potter, please get off my dick, yeah

[Verse 2: TrippyThaKid]
I’m like woah, I ain't messing with you, hoe
Trippy be the coolest on the west side of the globe
On the east side of the country, we be losing all control
People all over the world are fucking telling me we dope (Yuh)
International passenger, flying we dank (Trip)
Putting it together, I'm stronger than 3 tanks (Trip)
Bout to beat a boxer with them knockers in the ring (Trip)
Smoking on exotic and the product is green bank (Ayy, ayy)
Bbno$ and Trip the Kid, yeah we running it
Put some gravy on everything, we the ones that you bumpin'
And in your whip or the party, you got that lemon Bacardi
I got the pack of the millies, no homie let’s get it started
I'm sayin' bbno$ in China, TrippyThaMan on the moon, dude
Taking me out of the line up
Thinking what I'm gonna do, do
I can lift the world and I could drop it on your head, but if I really wanna kill you I'll just spit until you're dead, ayy
[Chorus: bbno$]
Diamonds plastic (What), bag Jurassic
How she work that booty, man she doin' magic, I like had to have it
Life Jurassic, wait
Bitch, I'm the goat
Flexing like the pope, I got secrets in my coat, yeah (Uh)
Rubies goin' through some menopause, you got the POV
Mind on my money, yeah that's the bare necessity (Fur)
Water, water, water, water, water, water, drip
Tater totter, Harry Potter, please get off my dick, yeah

[Outro: bbno$]
