Song title: Deep End Freestyle

[Intro: Fousheé]
Go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
(Great John on the beat by the way)

[Verse: Sleepy Hallow]
My body different
Shorty said she tryna kick it
I'm in her mouth, somethin' like a dentist
Cookin' up, I'm in the kitchen
Big bro wildin', tryna catch a victim
I took an L, but now I'm back, gang winnin'
Look, and I'm doin' well
Don't even ask how I'm livin' (Facts)
Niggas ain't real, they cap (Cap)
Ridin' round with the seat laid back
They told me to chill, I'm itchin' to clap
If I pull up, somebody get whacked
Boy, tie your laces, niggas tripping
Red lights, we gon' skip it
Fucked up a new V, we was dippin'
From the police, I was drillin'
But fuck it, let's skate on, huh
Run up a bag with my bro gods, huh (Bro)
Watch how I show off
Step in the room and she takin' her clothes off
I ain't even say much, huh
Ain't even do much
They like, "Sleepy, you too much"
Know I got a bag, right? Huh
Know I live a fast life
Said she fell in love, met her last night, huh
Said she want this shit for life
Girl, you must be dumb, no, you not the type, huh (What?)
No, I'm not the type
I think I was lost in a past life
Came back, got my cash right
Say you want the sauce, I can get you right
But it's heavyweight, not light (Hold up, hold up)
Bro keep a strap, somethin' like a dyke
He be shootin', he don't like to fight
I could get you wrapped up like a gift
Smoked up like a spliff
Chopper tell 'em back up or get hit
Got my racks up, now I'm lit
I could get you packed up in this bitch
And my blood blue 'cause I'm Crip
Fanny pack full of hundreds (That's a fact)
I just reach on my waist, seen he runnin' (Fuck outta here)
Bitches say a nigga stuntin', huh (Nigga stuntin')
Know they hate how I came up from nothin'
Backed down, get to drummin' (Baow, baow)
I'ma show a nigga how I'm comin'
I was down, now I'm uppin' (Now I'm up)
They was hatin' on me, now they lovin' (Oh wait, hold on)
[Outro: Fousheé]
Go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Bestie

[Intro]
Real hittas with me and they might shoot
Great John on the beat, by the way
I got some real hittas with me and they might shoot

[Bridge]
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh
That's your bestie, I'ma have to pick her
She said "don't neglect me," she said don't forget her
I'm the way you get a jet ski, better respect me
Money coming fast, moving slow, you getting left-y

[Verse 1]
They say that they love me, that's a lie
Keep my money wrapped up like a mummy, dead guys
In my pocket, I'ma stack it 'til my hundreds hit the sky
Remember she ain't want me, used to leave a nigga dry
Now she something like a bird, if I call, she'll fly
Pull up, what's the word, pray to God you don't die
I know they don't wanna see a nigga make it out the slums
Wanna see me dead or in jail, anyone
How you getting all that bread, wanna give a nigga crumbs
Shooters hit you close range with a and-1
Look
[Chorus]
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh
That's your bestie, I'ma have to pick her
She said "don't neglect me," she said don't forget her
I'm the way you get a jet ski, better respect me
Money coming fast, moving slow you getting left-y
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh

[Verse 2]
That's your... that's your bestie
All up on my news feed, body like a Pepsi
Know she fell in love with the gang
And she gon' do it all, we don't even know her name
Tell lil' mama get involved, pull up with a couple broads
Nigga you a fraud, you ain't who you say you are
We was probably playing blackjack, pull a nigga cards
You don't know the deal, you ain't seen a nigga scars
You don't know a nigga pain, free the gang
I was with them real hittas, tryna bust a nigga brain
Free 'Low fresh up out the chain, ain't say a thing
I'm tired of shooting 30's, for Christmas I want a K

[Chorus]
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, call a friend to come and get her, ooh
That's your bestie, I'ma have to pick her
She said "don't neglect me," she said don't forget her
I'm the way you get a jet ski, better respect me
Money coming fast, moving slow you getting left-y
Gang living, hate it when she got addicted
And she gon' get down, get down, get down...3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: 2 Fake

[Chorus]
You too fake, I can't fuck with you niggas
Can't fuck with you, too fake
On the block, I ain't make it to dinner
In the trap, I got my own plate
Leave her wet like a tub when I'm in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that's what made me a winner
You too fake, I can't fuck with you niggas
Can't fuck with you, too fake
On the block, I ain't make it to dinner
In the trap, I got my own plate
Leave her wet like a tub when I'm in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that's what made me a winner

[Post-Chorus]
If I call you my bro, then your bitch is untouchable, nigga
I ain't touching her, nigga
You past me that chop, I ain't bluffing, I'm busting a nigga
I'm busting a nigga, look

[Verse 1]
I'm addicted to choppers and long nights, devil on sight
Said he don't want me living a long life, but he wrong, right?
I know niggas be mad as shit, we gon' run up a bag and split it in half
Can't fuck up no packages, you saw my cuts, ain't bring no bandages
You left me hanging, wasn't mad you switched and that was the saddest
They got the federales tryna ask me shit, I get low and I'm passing
Got it that situation, got the back end grips, throwing bullets like Madden
We hit a touchdown on your block, it's lit, did him dirty for capping
No, we don't care what you jacking, you made a wrong move, that's a classic
Came with a long clip, everlasting, marry money, I'm in love with the cash and
Blue hundreds, think I find them attractive, look, look
[Chorus]
You too fake, I can't fuck with you niggas
Can't fuck with you, too fake
On the block, I ain't make it to dinner
In the trap, I got my own plate
Leave her wet like a tub when I'm in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that's what made me a winner
You too fake, I can't fuck with you niggas
Can't fuck with you, too fake
On the block, I ain't make it to dinner
In the trap, I got my own plate
Leave her wet like a tub when I'm in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that's what made me a winner

[Post-Chorus]
If I call you my bro, then your bitch is untouchable, nigga
I ain't touching her, nigga
You past me that chop, I ain't bluffing, I'm busting a nigga
I'm busting a nigga

[Verse 2]
I heard they want me dead, that's a myth, money on my head, come and get
Bag and flip a double gram, that's a lick, tryna get a hundred band every trip
All up in the cut, somethin' like a stitch, kill what? They ain't doing shit
Don't depend on no man, no bitch, bro, keep a suntan when it's brick
But, bitch, I'm in love with the money, gotta know I'm in love the money
She a treesh, she gon' come for the money, but I could bet you she can't get nothing from me
And I can stretch you, get you wrapped like a mummy, hit that whip, you gon' crash like a dummy
Disrespect, I just laugh, yeah, it's funny, they know what's up, my shooters making it ugly
[Chorus]
You too fake, I can't fuck with you niggas
Can't fuck with you, too fake
On the block, I ain't make it to dinner
In the trap, I got my own plate
Leave her wet like a tub when I'm in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that's what made me a winner
You too fake, I can't fuck with you niggas
Can't fuck with you, too fake
On the block, I ain't make it to dinner
In the trap, I got my own plate
Leave her wet like a tub when I'm in her
I fuck it up now she in love with a nigga
Make it hot in the middle of winter
I took a loss and that's what made me a winner

[Post-Chorus]
If I call you my bro, then your bitch is untouchable, nigga
I ain't touching her, nigga
You past me that chop, I ain't bluffing, I'm busting a nigga
I'm busting a nigga, look1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Lowkey

[Intro]
Great John on the beat, by the way
Nah, loyalty and love is different
Loyalty is some shit, like, you gotta see
Love, people throw that shit around a lot
People throw that shit around
I don't think nobody even knows what that shit means no more
Hm, look

[Chorus]
I liked it better when we was low-key
Now you tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me
Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O.D. 
Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me
Locked up in pain and you my co-D
For all the time that we waste, we gon' need some matching Rollies
Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley?
Girl, would you ride if it's a— look

[Verse 1]
Girl, I got some bad luck with love, so don't judge
You say you the one, so that makes two of us
You know I got some problems, I don't really trust
Took a lil' minute for my heart to adjust
I know you got some problems, you don't really trust
You don't wanna be the one to fall for a scrub
But it ain't what it was, it is what it is
Love it when I pull up, but you hate it when I dip
So you mad when I dip, we gon' take a trip
Vacation, thousand miles from the crib
'Member when you told me that you wish you would've quit?
Said you wasn't fuckin' with me, threw a whole fit
I was runnin' to a bag, told me stay up out the mix
She know I be stressin' 'cause my brothers in the bricks
You know how I'm livin', so I gotta take risks
Think I'm with some bitch, but I'm probably makin' hits
[Chorus]
I liked it better when we was low-key
Now you tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me
Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O.D. 
Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me
Locked up in pain and you my co-D
For all the time that we waste, we gon' need some matching Rollies
Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley?
Girl, would you ride if it's a— look

[Verse 2]
Every time I'm in a jam, you the one that I call
Pass my assist on the court, we gon' ball
Got a call from the gang, said they finna break the law
Know I gotta go, know I gotta get involved
Break up, make up, we done been through it all
Crawl 'fore I walk, stood ten toes tall
Even if we fall apart, both left a mark
Last one I'm lovin', after that it's fuck 'em all
I'm the best in the league, Mike Jordan
She gon' make it bounce like Spalding
I know what she need, ice water
Cool it down, she been actin' out of order
Actin' like she leavin', but she can't
Said her heart won't let her take the chance
She be actin' like she leavin', but she can't
Nuh-uh, won't let her take the chance, look
[Chorus]
I liked it better when we was low-key
Now you tellin' all your friends that I'm different, ain't the old me
Takin' these drugs, I'm 'bout to O.D. 
Can't tell me that you're loyal or you love, gotta show me
Locked up in pain and you my co-D
For all the time that we waste, we gon' need some matching Rollies
Girl, would you ride if it's a stoley?
Girl, would you ride if it's a—7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

So they fuck with it

[Chorus]
I get love in my city I know them niggas hate
All black when I’m getting busy just pray I beat the case

They fell in love with it so they fuck with it
Die bout’ this money if you want nigga it come get it

Put my niggas on in this song we gon’ make chicken)
[Chorus 2]
I get love in my city I know them niggas hate

Alright, we smooth, go through

So I'm keepin' it on me
(Great John on the beat, by the way)
Look, look

[Chorus: Sleepy Hallow]
Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it, hey

[Verse 1: Sleepy Hallow]
Pull out your camera, record it, huh
Flexin', I do this shit often
'Member back then, ain't have no money, huh
Now I got racks in my pocket
She think I'm buyin' her bags 'cause she gorgeous
She want Dior, I know she adore it
Take no checks, know bro gon' floor it
When you got a check, you're life ain't boring
Hold on, ballin', I feel like I'm Jordan
But this a different type of scorin'
They ain't want me, now they say I'm important
They painted my brother a portrait
I need a couple K for the walk-in
No regular whip, this a foreign
I cannot fuck her if she gon' be stalkin'
Like, Sleepy, why we never talkin'?
[Chorus: Sleepy Hallow]
Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it

[Verse 2: Sheff G]
Uh, they know I do what I want, I don't care how it seem
They say they love me but lately don't know what it mean
Sent a message to God and He left it on seen
But only to show me shit don't go as planned, huh
Told you was gon' be the man
Now I done spent bricks on shit way back, couldn't afford this, look, huh
I done lost racks, made it back in the back of apartments, look
We don't forgive and forget
We live life, here's your ass if you caught slippin', huh
I remember days we was trappin' out
Police outside, to the back, we out
Be the crack of dawn, nigga

[Chorus: Sleepy Hallow]
Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses
Boy, just watch how you be talkin', you know lil' bro gon' spark it
Look, I could be gone by the mornin', huh, so I'm keepin' it on me
She said she don't love nobody, I told her I was heartless
She said she just wanna party, uh, she fuck with bosses

Remember I had basketball dreams, uh

Great John on the beat, by the way
Ain't taking no days off

I feel like doing a check, I want that big bag, none less
Know I let that chopp' blast, ain't no threat
If he ain't dead, then he gotta be blessed
Money calling, know it's time to collect
You broke boy, you ain't moving correct
Flew to Cali and I met the connect
The threes told me where they get it the best
Rolling deep, I came with the set
The block love me, said I ain't like the rest
Ain't no problem, we getting them wet
The opps hate me, say I'm leaving a mess

So she dropping her dress

Swear, I used to wait for
Run through them hundrds a day, what we used to pray for
