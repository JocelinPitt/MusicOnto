Song title: RAPSTAR

[Intro]
(Shout out my nigga Synco)

[Chorus]
Uh (Tuned up), copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it (Uh, uh)
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 2]
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
[Chorus]
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it
I hear planes flyin', crowds screamin', money counters, chains clangin'
Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Outro]
When I'm finished, when I'm finished179EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Pop Out

[Intro]
JD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray
[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane97EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Martin & Gina

[Intro]
(Tahj Money)
(I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw, hey, Lilkdubb)

[Verse 1]
I think about you on the road when I tear down the booth
Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

[Chorus]
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)
[Verse 2]
I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

[Chorus]
He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub55EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Neva Cared (Remix)

[Verse]
Before I put it in, I smack her ass (Smack it)
Pull out my iFeezy, hit record, turn on the flash (Haha)
We gon' make a movie like Ray J and Kim Kardash' (Bitch)
Put her on the block list, that's if that pussy trash (Bitch)
I'm Polo G, stressing who? It ain't a bitch that I can't smash (Smash)
Prolly fucked her too, it ain't a bitch that I ain't had (Flex)
Man, this shit is nothing, you the type to hit and brag
Run yo' mouth too much, I'm starting to think you niggas fags (Fags)
Hard for me to slow down, I got used to living fast
Bitch, I love the gang, on granny, I'lla give them boys my last (Gang, gang, gang)
Only be with shootas, you can't hang if you don't blast
Please don't try me like DeJ Loaf, I put them killers on yo' ass (Boom, boom)
Always shouting out my block 'cause, bitch, that’s where I started
Ahead of my class, yeah, I always been the smartest (Bitch)
Ain't no competition even though they try they hardest
I know they be hating, but I'm in my bag regardless (Flex)
Give this shit a year or two, let's see who get the farthest
Don't play in these streets before you turn into a target (Boom, boom, boom)
You could think you crazy but my shorties get retarded
If I call up CCB, they scoring like they can't be guarded, bitch
That AR be shooting, I call it G-Unit 'cause you know that bitch stay with .50
Hair-trigger, just tap it, don't pull it, ain't saving no bullets, I shoot 'til it's empty
Like a yoga trainer, we be stretching shit
We come through with the TEC's, sendin' messages
Ain't no talk it out, police chalk him out, only way that we think we can settle shit
Had to cancel my old bitch, she was choosing, I ain't tripping, I'on miss her 'cause a thot gon' be a thot (Haha)
Niggas from the other side dissing my homies, I ain't tripping, just gon' kill him 'cause a opp gon' be a opp (Bitch)
Fuck that Wawa shit, we don't social beef, we grab Glocks
Spot News make reports when we speeding past blocks (Boom, boom, boom)
Bitch, it's nighttime, so we bringing out them red dots
Got a long nose nine and this bitch don't blow out snot
Feel like Jordan vs. Utah, I'm deadly with that last shot (Bitch)
Back to poking niggas, if I lose everything that I got
You keep flicking up with them rolls then we might have to enter yo' slot
Put that barrel on yo' head, take yo' new chain and yo watch (Pussy)
I been T'd since I got that news my homie dead
Caught yo homie lacking- (Bop, knocked off his dread)
Just for satisfaction, we'll come take off a nigga head (Haha)
Hollows like a deadly virus, bodies drop when that shit spread
Explode in his flesh, make a mess, get ripped to shreds
Show no mercy for the enemy, nobody getting spared
Man, you niggas bitches, why the fuck would I be scared?
Thirty shots up in my bomb, my momma told me, "Be prepared" (Ooh)
Heard the streets been talking, I know what they said
Capalot been gridin', shorty gon' get to that bread (Flex, flex)
Ballin' like I'm Bryant, no, not Kobe, bitch, Lil' Ed (Bitch)
See, you could stay on the sideline, I'ma run it up instead, ayy, uh
I'ma run it up instead
See, you could stay on the sideline, I'ma run it up instead, bitch
[Outro]
Lil Capalot in this bitch man
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on, man
Long live twin 'nem, 1300 twin 'nem gang, man
TimTim gang shit, man

Song title: 21

[Chorus]
Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

[Verse 1]
Swervin' on the E-way, don't care if I crash in this coupe
Shit I'm thinkin' 'bout too real, might lose my mind in this coupe
Can't relapse off these drugs, man, R.I.P. to Juice
We was tweakin' off them Percs, I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy, like who want smoke? We got plenty guns
Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs
It was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun
I just been ballin' on these niggas like I'm Kendrick Nunn
Every day my birthday, bitch, it's lit, I just turned twenty-one

[Chorus]
Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top
[Verse 2]
Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods
He the type to get excited 'cause he made The Shade Room

[Chorus]
Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top72EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Through da Storm

[Intro]
Hey big brother, it's me, Leia
Remember at the old house I said you was gonna be a big star one day?
I’m so proud of you
Mmh, mmh, mmh, Polo G
Live in the flesh

[Chorus]
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit
Talkin' to my lil' sister, phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin’
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about persevering
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it

[Verse 1]
Phone on DND, I'm out in Cali whippin' through the mountains
Just cruisin', feelin' my song, windows down, speakers pounding, yeah
My engine roaring and that Gucci tiger growling
Expensive taste, my clothes foreign, I be dripping like a fountain
Need new shoes, I started hustling ’cause I didn’t get no allowance
Speeding down the wrong path, found my lane, then I rerouted
Hottest in my city, I had every record label scouting
I got rich and left the hood, still don't leave the crib without it
Swear it ain’t no better feeling than thumbing through these thousands
So much money, can't keep track, I think I might need an accountant
I been runnin' up that check, them blue hundreds just keep piling
Came a long way from depression, all these riches keep me smiling
[Chorus]
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit
Talkin' to my lil’ sister, phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin'
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about persevering
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it

[Verse 2]
Couldn't leave my brother in them trenches, told him come and stay with me
We gon' live like kings for all them nights ain't have no place to sleep
Niggas watched us starving and never offered us a plate to eat
Took off, now they mad, but I know that they won't wait for me
Last year I took a trip to every place that I couldn't wait to see
Granny, I'm locked up again, sat in that station faithfully
Now I'm the golden child, I used to think my mama hated me
Ain't budging 'bout no problems, what a nigga gon' come take from me?
I heard you a robber, on that concrete, you gon' lay deceased
This .40 waving like a blowdryer, gon' hit his face with heat
With this shit for life, forever gang until I'm 83
Real niggas dyin', it seem like Heaven is the place to be

[Chorus]
Know my grandma still with me, when it get cold, I feel your spirit
Talkin' to my lil' sister, phone calls through Securus
Walk in court in them shackles, see my mama, her eyes tearin'
Tryna work towards these blessings but the devil keep interfering
Everybody go through something, it's all about persevering
They was counting me out, I put passion in every lyric
Fuck a sack up at Neimans, spend some racks on my appearance
Yeah, I know that they hate, I'm the man, ain't tryna hear it46EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Finer Things

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Verse 1]
Hard headed, I grew up resilient
It wasn't no heroes, so we looked up to the villains
For generations, bitch, my side of town been drillin'
We been at war ever since them red buildings
It's hard to make peace once blood get to spillin', ayy
Lil Wooski get to shootin' like he filmin'
Yeah, my friends died too, I know that feeling
I'm poppin' ecstasy to help me with the healin'
Leia and lil' baby my younger siblings
I really love 'em, so I treat 'em like my children
Leilani told me stack them bands to the ceiling
I switched my swag up, can't you tell the difference?
I'm finna feed the whole gang with these millions
I'm finna buy my whole hood with these millions
Girl, if I give you my time, that's a privilege
But I can only give my heart to the realest
[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members, then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been feelin' like fuck the streets, this shit a scam
These days, if it ain't 'bout money, I don't give a damn
I'm just gon' get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on Instagram
Still with the gang though, one false move, them killers blam
Still on that same block for those who say they look for me
I ain't sacrifice the shit I lost, it was took from me
Almost went insane, went insane, went insane
From all this pain, all this pain, all this pain
Turned that pain into passion and made it happen
Shout out to the ones who doubted me, they keep me laughin'
Sippin' on this codeine got me relaxin'
She say she like how I be swaggin', she love my fashion
VVS my diamonds, my jewelry flashin'
Drip so hard, I'm makin' puddles, bitch, my Gucci splashin'
Fresh to death like my closet in the casket
Fresh to death like my closet in the casket
[Chorus]
Yeah, I know
You be posted up from Sunday to Saturday night
Started hangin' with the members then you blew a few pipes
And you gon' do the dash if you see them blue lights
A lot of people dyin' and it's a chance that you might
You got God on your side, but it's hard to do right
Don't pay them haters no mind, you can be what you like
Tryna leave this in the past, grindin' for a new life

Ayy, grindin' for a new life
Grindin' for a new life
Grindin' for a new life, ayy53EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: I Know

[Intro]
(Pipe that shit up, TnT)
(Dmac on the fuckin' track)
(Tahj Money)

[Chorus]
Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

[Verse 1]
Let's just be friends before we rush into a label
Wanna know if you really fuck with me, girl, what's your angle?
It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
Trauma got me fucked up, so I'm mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you
Most times I'm by myself, I'm still confused from betrayal
From rags to riches, shit still hard, I'm just on phase two
[Chorus]
Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care

[Verse 2]
Livin' on his own and he runnin' out of options now
'Cause he felt like he couldn't be hisself at his mama house
Hittin' licks, missin' school, junior year, he thought 'bout droppin' out
Him against the world, 40 on him when he poppin' out
On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise
Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed
He wanna stand over a nigga, leave his face destroyed
He miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid

[Chorus]
Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share
My dawg was one of a kind, I know your type rare
I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

(Tahj Money)

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s
In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed
Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease
He gon' let that 9 blow with ease
Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?
I know she might cry if I leave
I been fooled by liars and thieves
Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

[Verse 1]
Once you give my pussy up, it's over with
Miss who you used to be, 'cause that's who I was closer with
I'm in my bag now, I act like I don't know the bitch
Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits
Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list
You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick
They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic
I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick
My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists
Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche
Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick
Every day a gamble with your life, all we know is risk
From the Windy City where you bound to see the coldest shit
[Chorus]
I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s
In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed
Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease
He gon' let that 9 blow with ease
Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?
I know she might cry if I leave
I been fooled by liars and thieves
Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze

[Verse 2]
Switches on them glizzys, get to blowin' like it's four of me
Promise to my son that the streets won't get no more of me
Remember every line from that obituary poetry
See they peep I'm ballin' now, just go back to ignorin' me
Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me
Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me
See him in person and that boy won't stand on shit he been sayin'
Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van
You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone
Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along
If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on
Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone
Independent, her hair down, and she feelin' grown
Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone
And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong
I got a playlist for your heart, girl, pick a song
[Chorus]
I'm so sick of farewells and R.I.P.'s
In the trenches yellin', "Gang gang," mob ties what I bleed
Don't claim to be an opp, 'cause niggas die from that disease
He gon' let that 9 blow with ease
Can I speak my mind, can I breathe?
I know she might cry if I leave
I been fooled by liars and thieves
Iced out my Rollie, but I know time cannot freeze30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"

[Verse 1: Polo G]
We make it hot up on your block, we let that heat blow
Catch an opp, we dump the clip, it's time to reload
Put a scope on the AR just like a peephole
Think he a bully, we got choppers for the Deebo
Seven-figure nigga, tryna maximize them three O's
Before the bag, I was fucking all the freak hoes
Ballin' hard, young legend out the Chi, bitch, I'm like D-Rose
"Cap, how you make it out this shit?" I got the cheat code
Way more than life than just the hood, I'm tryna reach goals
Maxine my heart, since you've been gone, I miss your sweet soul, ayy
Never tell a statement, we won't leak those
Better not go talkin' to them people, better keep closed
[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"

[Verse 2: Polo G]
We hold a grudge and we want blood, we can't look past the issue
Play with us and you gon' die, nigga, it's kinda simple
Show no mercy, we gon' kill whoever ridin' with you
Catch you on the other side, then we gon' have to get you
Condolences to your family, they gon' have to miss you
Lil Joe on go and he gon' spark, that's if I pass the signal
My right-hand mans, he got his name 'cause he gon' blast the pistol
Earned our stripes, we gon' blow if a nigga play foul, you would think we had a whistle
Lil Capalot, G-O-A-T, yeah, that's that guy's initials
Happiness and depression, I'm stuck inside the middle
I fell in love with dollar signs, won't let my mind forget you
Fuck it off, we spend it all on fast cars and shinin' crystals

[Chorus: Polo G]
My youngins heartless, so they ain't playin' no games
We really want 'em dead, he got hit up close range
He fucked up in the head, he wanna see some more brains
On that corner, I couldn't stay up out that dope game
My cousin got indicted dealin' cocaine
She an Instagram addict, she want more fame
I used to starve, now I'm blowing up like propane
Told my inner self, "I promise you I won't change"38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
