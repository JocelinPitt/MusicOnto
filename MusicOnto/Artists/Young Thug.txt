Song title: Best Friend

[Intro]
Ricky Racks, I see you!
Thugger!
YSL for life, bitch
Yeah fuck you, your momma and everything else
Yung Shad, you killed this track
Free the GOAT!

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah

[Verse 1]
Take them boys to school, swagonometry
Bitch I'm bleedin' bad, like a bumble bee
Hold up! Hold it, hold it, nigga proceed
I'ma eat that booty just like groceries
Eat on that coochie, lay that bitch down like "let's do it"
No Tiger, bitch, eat that wood, eat that wood
Supplier, bitch, I got pistols, no wood
I want them tacos that are Meagan Good
Helicopter choppin' with the buzz
Stuff them racks inside them if they nudge
Bang that other side, nigga curb
And my reefer louder than a speaker
Yeah my niece is hangin' with The Beatles
If you ever find her, better keep her
37 cameras for the sneakers
Goin' out like Ox or Beanie Sigel
Send a cop, I can't wait to mistreat 'em
Forcin' your ho, I can't wait to mislead 'em
And beat 'em, they ain't my people
[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you how I spent a couple hundreds today
I done cut back on that lean, I'm on that Hen' and D'ussé
Don't do no talkin', when you see him, you better shoot in his face
I got a hundred bitches that can't wait to replace
Michael Jackson, nigga, Thugger Jackson moon walkin'
The S.L.I.M.E. army tool shoppin'
Me a horny goat, I'm boolin' at the bull stop
No I can't get arrested 'cause I'm talkin' 'bout my necklace
I'ma put that bitch in the buck, I'm a dog, let's get stuck
My lil' sister Dora, eat them Lucky Charms and give me luck
Waddup cuz? Here yo cup, call my Bloods, bring my bup
Your crew suck, don't got bucks, these ain't drugs, nigga

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek

Woah, woah

Oh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)
Up north, down south, Bankhead to Rachel Walk (Ayy)
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter (Let's go)
I'ma run the compound (Yeah)
I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woo)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh-huh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra)
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I, crash down, we get money (Hey)
For the full town (Woah, when you won't play, I)

Song title: Power

[Intro]
We got London on da Track

[Chorus]
First you get that money, then you get that power
If he tune his nose up, boy, he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser
Bitch, I make it rain-shower, ya dig that?
They won't know a thing about you if you zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back
Feed that, beat that, never crack, dig that (Sheesh, sheesh)

Before I go without a sack, I swag pack (Sheesh, sheesh)
I spoiled my bitch and now she actin' like a brat (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, yeah, bitch, I'm bleedin' like a tat (Yeah, yeah)
Roll it, roll it for me on ya back (Roll it, roll it)
Just for show my diamonds yellow like a taxi (Woo, woo)

If he tune his nose up, boy, he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser

They won't know a thing about you if you zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back
Feed that, beat that, never crack, dig that (Sheesh, sheesh)

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I dig it, I eat ice cream with my chickens
Bitch, I'm rich just like a Simmons, not Lil Diggy (Real Simmons)
If I got legs, bitch you know I'm gonna get it
She got good head, so she welcome to my Bentley
Big bid-ness in that big Bentley, Bentley (What? What?)
Ridin' 'round with that semi, 'cause I know these niggas envy (Hah)
Is you mad 'bout Instagram or how I kick my pimpin'? (Pimp)
You keep that Ace of Spades, I'm sippin'
I'm a rocket, rocket, I can't stop it, stop it

If you try to run off (What?), you know we popped your noggin
(Pop-pop)

[Chorus]
First, you get that money, then you get that power
If he tune his nose up, boy, he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars, and I also got rentals, and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceiling
Stoner my lifestyle
I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud
That money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab
[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 2]
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thug Attendant
Hundred bands at a time I fronted you bags, but you
I don't like using profanity, but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern
[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)

Song title: Hot

[Intro: Gunna]
Wheezy outta here
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs
[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out
[Outro: Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, damn

Song title: Hot (Remix)

[Intro: Gunna]
Wheezy outta here
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs
[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out (Oh)
[Interlude: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
Cash, money, checks, cash (Ooh, ah)
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos (Ooh)
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself  (Ah)
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite (Ooh, it's lit)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Hot like the 504 Boyz how I move through the lobby (Hot)
Since '012, La Flame been hot just to show you the timeframe (La Flame)
Hundred mil' down on my desk, but I'm still up deciding (Straight up)
Match the M's in my account to the truck in my driveway (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm in that four-door by myself
Know it's a hundred more niggas outside
Know they gon' ride 'til the death (Ooh)
Had some good years, ain't no way I get tired
I gotta do what I feel
Every day Super Bowl, fuck it, oh well
I put a lot on myself
In the field, Richard Mille on like Odell (Let's go)
She slid her hand down my pants just to grab the torpedo (Doo-doo-doo)
I had to go back and link with my slimes like I'm thirteen and zero (It's lit)
I told her, "Baby, this not the remix, this a part of the sequel" (Part of the seq')
No, we not livin' the same, we not makin' the same, we not equal (No), yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, mom, I can fly
Had some troubles, put that shit in the sky
Brought the angels, know the devil would try
It's so hot, you thought Paris Hilton done said it (Yeah, yeah)
When we come out, we can't help but leave damage (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Afterparty, Astroworld out the planet (Yeah, yeah)
Laid the map out, but they didn't understand it
When I'm home, know that I fuck on a Grammy, yeah
[Outro: Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, damn

Song title: Thief in the Night

[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
Just like a G, you know?
Trouble, Trouble, what's popping, 5?
B4, let's do it
Yee!
I wake up and go get me some new money
You know I'm living like a G
These lil' niggas ain't gonna take nothin' from me
You know we do it like a G
I swear to God I fuck on anyone
Just like a gangsta, just like a G
This Duct Tape and YSL
You know I do it like a G
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down
G's up, hoes down

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike
[Verse 1: Young Thug & Trouble]
I go down on a dyke, I go up on my price
I might drop Kimbo Slice, kidnap like Uncle Ice
I got grits at the beach and they white like a rice
Let Trouble take your life
After I give you five
Straight put that five to the side
It ain't no question how nigga gon' ride
When they come with them questions
My nigga get quiet, sh sh, nigga sit quiet, sh sh
I am not taking no disrespect
You Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin'
No that won't happen on me
I drop a key like the mufuckin' beat
I look good as your dad on a Friday
So many cars I gotta buy a driveway
Never gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day
Serving these X and P's instead of poppin'
Pockets fat up like they jumped 'em
YSL, that slimy anaconda (Yeah)
Bicking back, being bool like a uncle (Yeah)
I'm so geeked up, I might fuck a condom

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike
[Verse 2: Trouble & Young Thug]
I get 'em all on the rice (On the rice)
She didn't even know what it was but she taste it
I dig in, her shit sound like Jason
I be on Percocets more than occasion
They betting on me like in Vegas
Betting on me like I'm Vegas
Stick to the code man, there won't be no trace
Thugga Thugga, tell me what would you say?
What would you say?
No J Money, but my gun say, "Bow"
Pop a molly, look at her then fiend
I'm the target mofucka, no beam
No this shit is not good as it seems
I might give her the boot with no jeans
I kick shit like a chong and a ching
I'm a boss, I'm 'bout that unity
Sandwiches, you know you in between
And you gotta know we at the green
You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean
Gotta have paper for lawyer fees
You ain't with it, you a L
Still getting it, yeah, bails
Break it down on the scale
If it add up, hell yeah, I do it
Lap back as he ran to it
[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
