Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Verse 1]
Oh my god, oh my god, this feeling's just begun
Saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

[Verse 2]
Oooh, oh my god, oh my god, can't believe what I've become
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung
Oh my god, oh my god, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
(Tells me to stop)
[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us
Try to fight it, but it's never enough ('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop

[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum (Mmm)
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum
But my heart goes

'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum
Ba-ba-ba-dum ba-ba-dum ba-ba-da-dum

My head and my heart
I can't tell them apart
My head tells me to run, but I can't
[Chorus]

Song title: Sorry

[Verse 1]
I can't live without you
I know I did you wrong, I know I did you wrong
And it's my fault, I'm sorry
I can see my whole world changing 'cause of you
It's upside down, I'm lonely
Should have known better, should have know you're my best friend
Come back here, give me one more try

[Hook]
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you
What I did was wrong, I'm sorry
I didn't know how much I really miss you
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you
What I did was wrong, I'm sorry
I didn't know how much I really miss you

[Verse 2]
Last night I made a big mistake
Now I'm sitting in my room like brandy
Taking time to contemplate
I've been such a fool lately
I can't live without you
I know I did you wrong, I know I did you wrong
And it's my fault, I'm sorry
I can see my whole world changing 'cause of you
It's upside down, I'm lonely
Should have known better, should have know you're my best friend
Come back here, give me one more try
[Hook]
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you
What I did was wrong, I'm sorry
I didn't know how much I really miss you
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you
What I did was wrong, I'm sorry
I didn't know how much I really miss you

[Verse 3]
Lately we just fuss and fight
We argue 'bout everything
That drove me to leave that night
And tell you that it's the end

[Hook]
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you
What I did was wrong, I'm sorry
I didn't know how much I really miss you
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

L-l-l-l-lonely, l-l-l-l-lonely
L-l-l-l-lonely now

[Verse 1]
You are the one who said it's over
Now you wanna come back
So take your hand off my shoulder
This time it's not like that 'cause I know where your heart's at

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you like to be alone, but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Yeah, I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life
I guess you're missing me now

[Chorus]
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
Just because you're lonely
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely
Don't mean that you can play with my heart
Who do you think you are?
[Verse 2]
You say you've changed and you're different
But I don't wanna hear that
Your friends are saying that you miss me
But I already know that 'cause I know where your heart's at

I know you like to be alone, but hate being lonely
When you see me doing well, that's when you call me
Yeah, I'm doing fine, don't need you in my life

You don't have to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You can speak your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
You don't have to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You could've been mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
[Chorus]
Just because you're lonely (Just because you're lonely)
Doesn't mean we go back to the start
Just because you're lonely (Just because you're lonely)
