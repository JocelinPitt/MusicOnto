Song title: Habits of My Heart

[Intro]
I can't, say no
It's ripping me apart

[Verse 1]
In a dark room, in cold sheets
I can't feel a damn thing
I lost myself between your legs
Your medicine is in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'd rather be alone, yeah
But then you call me on the phone

[Chorus]
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

[Verse 2]
I tell myself "I like that"
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident, I'll give you that
But if you love yourself, you can fuck yourself
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather be alone
But you fermented in my bones

[Chorus]
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close...9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: I’ll Be Good

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw the devil this morning
Looking in the mirror
Drop of rum on my tongue with a warning
To help me see myself clearer

[Pre-Chorus]
I never meant to start a fire
I never meant to make you bleed
I'll be a better man today

[Chorus]
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times that I never could

[Verse 2]
My past has tasted bitter for years now so I wield an iron fist
Grace is just weakness, or so I've been told
I've been cold, I've been merciless

[Pre-Chorus]
But the blood on my hands scares me to death
Maybe I'm waking up today
[Chorus]
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should
I'll be good, I'll be good
(I'll be good, I'll be good)

[Bridge]
For all of the light that I shut out
For all of the innocent things that I doubt
For all of the bruises I've caused and the tears
For all of the things that I've done
All these years, no, yeah
For all of the sparks that I stomped out
For all of the perfect things that I doubt

[Chorus]
I'll be good, I'll be good
And I'll love the world like I should yeah
I'll be good, I'll be good
For all of the times I never could
For all of the times I never could37EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: We Won’t

[Intro: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 a.m. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would

[Verse 1: Jaymes Young]
Are we just gonna stay like this forever, floating?
I'm serious, my heart is furious
Cause I'm so confused when we're together
Feels like I'm choking, these emotions
I know I'm gonna let you down
So don't hold your breath now

[Pre-Chorus: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
Bittersweet in your mouth
Can you stomach the doubt?
I wish I could say what I'm feeling
I'm scared to let these words out

[Chorus: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 a.m. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would
And don't cry no more for me
Don't waste your time convincing me
That maybe someday we'll get it right
Cause we never could, I wish that we would
[Post-Chorus: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
But we won't, so just don't
We won't, so just don't
But we won't, so just don't
Don't

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan]
I can't trust you
Baby, cause I don't want to
This isn't fun anymore, never hurt like this before
Broken dishes on the floor
Hearts exploding
Tell me why I'm still holding
Onto the love that we've been breaking
Damn, I thought we'd make it
No other way to say it, don't, don't, don't

[Chorus: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 a.m. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would
And don't cry no more for me
Don't waste your time convincing me
That maybe someday we'll get it right
Cause we never could, I wish that we would
[Bridge: Jaymes Young & (Phoebe Ryan)]
We burn faster than a cigarette in my mouth
(I know it hurts, but baby, we can't stop now)
(Baby, we can't stop now)

[Chorus: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
Don't go to war for me
I'm not the one that you want me to be
Don't call me up at 2 a.m. tonight
It feels so damn good and I wish you would
And don't cry no more for me
Don't waste your time convincing me
That maybe someday we'll get it right
Cause we never could, I wish that we would

[Post-Chorus: Jaymes Young & Phoebe Ryan]
But we won't, so just don't
We won't, so just don't
But we won't, so just don't
(We won't so just don't)
Don't
Don't

Song title: Moondust

[Verse 1]
I'm building this house on the moon
Like a lost astronaut
Looking at you like a star
From a place the world forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's nothing that I can do
Except bury my love for you

[Chorus]
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

[Verse 2]
Nothing can breathe in the space
Colder than the darkest sea
I have dreams about the days
Drivin' through your sunset breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
But the first thing that I will do
Is bury my love for you
[Chorus]
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust

[Verse 3]
I'm a castaway and then reap what they sow
And I say what I know to be true
Yeah I'm livin' far away on the face of the moon
I've buried my love to give the world to you

[Chorus]
The brightness of the sun will give me just enough
To bury my love in the moondust
I long to hear your voice, but still I make the choice
To bury my love in the moondust
I've buried my love in the moondust, yeah28EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Happiest Year

[Verse 1]
I'm really on the ropes this time
I've been fighting all my life for you
I never should've said goodbye
But maybe that's what stupid people do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you gave me peace
And I wasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again
Asking for nothing

[Chorus]
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Don't think I could forgive myself
I'm sorry for the ways that I used you
And I could care less right now
But you know, you hurt me pretty good too
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we made each other bleed
And we tasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, love, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again

[Chorus]
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Oh, thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh

[Verse 3]
So wake me up when they build that time machine
I want to go back
Wake me up when you were sleeping next to me
'Cause I really loved you, ooh

[Chorus]
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life ooh
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, yeah
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Stone

[Verse 1]
Your father came and went like the ocean’s tide
And the day he left he never said goodbye
Your mother started drinking like the whole world died
You’ve been waiting for a miracle all your life

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if the fires don’t burn it down
The rains will wash it away
If you’re looking for solid ground
A stone will never break

[Chorus]
So give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be

[Verse 2]
You spend your nights looking at the stars
Thinking your life would be better on Mars
Checking your pulse just to feel it beat
Looking for a stone to keep the peace

[Chorus]
Give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be
[Bridge]
'Cause if the fires don’t burn it down
The rains will wash it away
And if you’re looking for solid ground
A stone will never break

[Outro]
So give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
Give me all your pain
And love will set you free
Give me all your shame
Put all your weight on me
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be
And I'll be the stone that you need me to be3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Feel Something

[Verse 1]
I don't care if it hurts
I'll pay my weight in blood
To feel my nerves wake up
So love me now or let me go
Let me feel these high and lows
Before the doors to my heart close

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me someone
I'm too young to feel so
Numb, numb, numb, numb
You could be the one to

[Chorus]
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
Show me that you're human, ohh
Make me feel something, something

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd miss the bittersweet
I gave those years away
And lost my sense of taste
'Cause all of your lovers eventually fade
And leave you alone in the bed you made
And all of the colors that bleed to gray leave nothing
[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me someone
I'm too young to feel so
Numb, numb, numb, numb
So give me just enough to

[Chorus]
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
Show me that you're human, ohh
Make me feel something, something

[Bridge]
So if you're gonna stay, then stay
But if you're gonna go
Make sure that you hurt me just enough to

[Chorus]
Make me feel something, something
Make me feel something, something
Show me that I'm human, ohh
Make me feel something, something

[Outro]
Make me feel something, something13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Baby, don't hurt me

This is our life, our time
When we are together, I need you forever
Is it love?

Song title: Don’t You Know

[Verse 1]
I've been walking in the moonlight looking for you
I got nobody but my shadow to get me through
So put your lips on my scars and teach me to love
Give my slow heart the rhythm of a blood drum

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you to go
I need more of you in my life
Nobody should be alone
Please let me take you home tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you know that I, don't you know I want you so bad
And every night I call for you
Don't you know that I, don't you know I want you so bad
I'd do anything to touch you
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I'm going mad
And in the moment I fall for you
Don't you know that I, don't you know I want you so bad (so bad)
I'd do anything to love you

[Verse 2]
Take a look at these mountains I'm moving for you
I'm gonna light the dynamite, I'm gonna break through
'Cause I know all the ways to appreciate your design
I'm a damn good lover, shivers up your spine
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you to go
I need more of you in my life
Nobody should be alone
Please let me take you home tonight

Don't you know that I, don't you know I want you so bad

And in the moment I fall for you
