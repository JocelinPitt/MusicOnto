Song title: Freaks

[Verse 1]
Don't kill me, just help me run away
From everyone, I need a place to stay
Where I can cover up my face
Don't cry, I am just a freak

[Chorus]
I am just a freak
I am just a freak
I am just a freak

[Verse 2]
My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
Hopefully I won't wake up this time

[Outro]
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time
I won't wake up this time34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Disco

[Verse 1]
I can't help it with you
Stubborn-hearted blue
Lights come into the room
When disco plays our tune

[Chorus]
'Cause there's nothing like it, not like the way you move
I can try but I can't hide it from you
'Cause I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you

[Verse 2]
Admire all of you
But fire burns me too
Can't stop that disco getting through
Can't stop that disco wanting you

[Chorus]
'Cause there's nothing like it, locking my eyes with you
I can't fight it, splitting my mind in two
'Cause I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Heathers

[Verse 1]
You should call me tonight when you are sleeping
So I can talk to all of your dreams

[Chorus]
And they'll tell me what to do
When I'm alone with you
'Cause I really do not understand
What the fuck is wrong with you

[Verse 2]
I've been crazy for this boy, I really like his gun
I think he's kind of crazy, but I've got nowhere to run

[Chorus]
And he tells me what to do
And he wants me to kill you
And I really think I might
Because, Heather, I hate you7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Forever Dumb

[Verse 1]
I  would run away from you if I could
Never really wanted to, but I guess I should run
I would fall in love with you, but I can't
It's too hard, maybe we'll just pretend

[Chorus]
But it's hard when I don't know what to do
I'm angry and I'm tired and confused
I've got so many thoughts stuck in my head
And none of them make much sense

[Verse 2]
I said I would follow you, but I lied
Don't be mad, well, at least I tried
I never had a spot for you in my life
Which was true 'til I heard you cry

[Chorus]
And your tears went down your face into my eyes
I'm sorry and I hate myself this time
'Cause I've got so many thoughts stuck in my head
And none of them make much sense6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Goth Babe

[Verse 1]
I want a goth babe in my life
I want someone who can bite
I want to listen to The Cure
I want to tell you that I'm yours
We can shoegaze in my room
So we can sing about our gloom
I want to feel you in my soul

[Chorus]
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
Ooh
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I want a goth babe in my head
A girl dressed in black and red
To do a seance in my bed
And then we'll fuck 'til we're both dead
Candle wax dropped on my nips
While we worship Robert Smith
I want to feel you in my soul
[Chorus]
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
Ooh
If you feel the way I do
If you feel the way I do
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Song title: In My Head Till I’m Dead

[Verse 1]
Why do I waste all my time
Thinking of you? I'd rather die
Your eyes are always in my mind
It keeps me awake every night

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you're in my head, in my head, ooh
You're in my head, in my head, ooh
You're in my head, in my head, ooh
You're in my head, in my head, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 2]
I've never felt so much pain
If I close my eyes, I see your face
When I'm alone, I scream your name
My Lolita, I'm not insane

[Chorus 2]
But you're in my head, in my head, ooh
You're in my head, in my head, ooh
You're in my head, in my head, ooh
You're in my head, in my head, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, ooh

Song title: I’m Not Making Out With You

[Verse 1]
We drove around in your car, woah
We didn't drive very far, woah
'Cause your tongue was in my mouth, woah
And I'm thinking of someone else, woah

[Chorus]
I'm not making out with you
Even though I think you're cute
I'm not making out with you
'Cause you always make me blue

[Verse 2]
We were sitting in your room, woah
And I wanted to leave soon, woah
But you had to kiss me first, woah
In my head, I thought of her, woah

[Chorus]
I'm not making out with you
Even though I think you're cute
I'm not making out with you
'Cause you always make me blue1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Fire Walk With Me

[Verse 1]
Fire walk away with me, tonight, tonight
I wrote in my diary that I'm fine, that I'm fine
Let's hang out by the train tracks tonight, tonight
Split that golden heart with me, I'll be your guy, your guy

[Chorus]
Fire walk with me, fire walk with me
Fire walk with me, fire walk with me

[Verse 2]
Let's get drunk in my room, it's red, it's red
There is something in my room, in my head, in my head
Laura Palmer, where's she been? She's dead, she's dead
Someone tell her father she's dead, she's dead

[Chorus]
Fire walk with me, fire walk with me
Fire walk with me, fire walk with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
