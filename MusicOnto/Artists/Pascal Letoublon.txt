Song title: Friendships (Lost My Love)

[Verse 1]
You left a mark in my mind that I never could erase
Took a piece from my heart that nobody could replace
Nobody could replace you
You are the eye in the storm, you're the piece I try to find
When I'm out in the cold, you're the one that's on my mind
Will search until I find you

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my love to you
I lost my love to you

[Chorus]
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
Was hoping that you knew (Na-na-na-na)
Don't know what else to do (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you

[Verse 2]
I've been alone in my dreams, but I've always searched for you
Needed love in this place, you're the only one I knew
The only one to fix me
Carried away by the wind, hope it takes me in your arms
Only place where I'm safe, only you can heal my scars
The only one to save me
I'm on my way over the deep blue sea
I'll be searching for your light house to lead me
[Chorus]
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
Was hoping that you knew (Na-na-na-na)
Don't know what else to do (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you

[Post-Chorus]
I lost my love (Was hoping that you knew)
Oh-oh-oh (Don't know what else to do)
I lost my love to you (Na-na-na-na)
I lost my love to you
I lost my love to youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
