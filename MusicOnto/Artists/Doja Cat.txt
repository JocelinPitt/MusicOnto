Song title: Say So

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it bad
Take it, own it, steal it fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

[Chorus]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so106EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, "What if?", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

[Verse 3: SZA]
Say give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (Exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half man, lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (All this ass)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you
[Chorus: Doja Cat, SZA & Both]
Can you kiss me more?

Song title: Ain’t Shit

[Intro]
Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit

[Verse 1]
Umm, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
[Chorus]
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause

[Verse 2]
Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (Your cousin)
Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fuckin' job

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent

[Chorus: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Uh)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the Rams, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, I'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Geppetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee
[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with

Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass

Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?

I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I'd flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends are pretend, wanna enter when you get big
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can’t handle rejection, stand my reflection
Damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I'm the ’shine once guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stares to the street, to the gutter, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say “Mother never weep”
My brother finds blood
I say “Shut up 'fore she sees”
Another motherfucking treat
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth
Spittin' natural disasters
God told me, “Cat, don't mess with the past tense”
You’re testing the masters
So guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models
This Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles
Someone hexed all the bottles
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh
[Chorus]
Better luck next time
Be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Better luck next time)
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be—

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
They said, "Doja hit so sticky," I said, "Thank you very much"
Bent the whole world over and said, "Spank you very much"
Cheese like pizzeria
Have a seat, bitch, please, Ikea
From the Westside like Maria
I'm hot like grits, Madea
Beat the pussy up, call PETA
I rock the boat like Aaliyah (Ayy)
I rock a bob like Sia (Ayy)
Doja on deck, bitch, re-up (Ayy)
Thick in the thigh, thick in the waist
Thick in the right motherfuckin' places
Hits like Venus, Serena (Ayy)
He wanna eat up the caesar (Ayy)
Bonita, bonita, bonita (Ayy)
Baby girl needed the wiener (Ayy)
Dug in the guts and I skeet her (Ayy)
Arena, arena, arena (Hey)
I'm in the hall, Regina
I'm on the wall at Genius
I am the wiz, the teacher
Skinny legend like Wiz Khalifa (Woo)
[Chorus: Doja Cat & Rico Nasty]
Hair grow long like Chia
Money go long like Nia

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
They said, "Rico, you so nasty," I said, "Thank you very much" (Yeah)
He just wanna eat me like some candy, but I'm not his buttercup
These hoes swear that they can't stand me
But ain't never pullin' up (Um)
I just made a hundred K in two weeks
Lil' bitch, do you need me to pull it up? (Duh)
Big black trucks and we pullin' up (Bitch)
She drank so much, now she throwin' it up
But we don't give a fuck, we still rollin' it up
I got a lot of money, but a lot ain't enough
Park where I want, they ain't towin' us (Bitch)
I-I make the jokes, you ain't trollin' us (Bitch)
My neck is on ice, you ain't cold as us
And when we hop out, yeah, you know it's us
My-my chopper sing like Sia (Sia)
Make a bitch sick, diarrhea (Ew)
Dressed in all black, grim reaper (Bitch)
Don't act like you can't see us (Yeah)
Ride-ridin' in a foreign, no Prius
He keep callin' my phone, Nokia
So I put the nigga on speaker
If you got a problem, better speak up
[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Hair grow long like Chia
Money go long like Nia
I am the big idea
My twins big like Tia
My twins big like Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera
Hair grow long like Chia
Money go long like Nia
I am the big idea
My twins big like Tia
My twins big like Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
Tia, Tamera (Uh, wait)
