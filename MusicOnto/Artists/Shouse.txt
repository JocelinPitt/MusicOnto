Song title: Love Tonight

[Intro: Choir]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1: Bec Rigby, Oscar Key Sung, Christobel Elliott, Tony Barnao]
When you're tired, when you're lonely
You can just reach out an arm
Know I'll be there
I'll help you weather the storm
Us together, nothing's ever
Felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone

[Chorus: Choir]
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight (It's all I need)
All I need is your love tonight (Tonight, tonight, ooh)
Ooh (Love tonight)

[Verse 2: Maia, Daisy Catterall, Monte Morgan, Mohini]
In that moment, when you're feeling
Like there's nothing at all
Reach out to me
Know that I'll answer the call
Us together, nothing's ever
Felt more like home
Know I'll be there
You will never be alone
[Chorus: Choir]
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight
All I need is your love tonight1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
