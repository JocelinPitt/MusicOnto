[Intro: Bruno Mars]
Talking to the moon
Talking to the moon
Talking to the moon
Talking to the moon

[Verse 1: Realestk]
Temptations, it's knocking on your door
And you're waiting
On me, baby (On me, woah, oh)
Won't you hold me close?
Baby, I'll go wherever you go
Even if it means that I'm on the road tonight

[Verse 2: Realestk]
And I don't need all your company
Baby, you can't get enough of me
I wait for you to wait for me tonight
Baby, take my hand
I promise we'll be fine
'Cause baby, I am yours
And baby, you are mine

[Pre-Chorus: Realestk]
But baby, trust me again
And baby, we'll be fine
And now she's walking
And I don't understand, baby
Why can't you—
[Chorus: Realestk]
Wait for me?
Wait for me?
Wait for me?
Wait for me?

[Outro: Realestk]
Temptations
It's knocking on your door
And you're waiting
On me, on me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: SWM

And I'm waiting on your call
About to risk it all
Baby, you've been outside
Tell me why haven't you called me
You been playing me from the start
But I know
I don't care (no,no)


Cause I don't need somebody hurting you
So baby stay stay with me
When I don't
Let you go
And you
Let me know
When I don't, let you go
And you

Why couldn't you wait
Then why aren't you going to stay with me
What did I do
For you to walk away from me
And I gave you all of me
And i caught you when you fell from me
Now tell me what did you change,right up on me
Now tell me what didn't you wait for someone like me
Now she's running back to me
To apologize, but I ain't got the time
So please
Cause I don't need somebody hurting you
So baby stay stay with me
When I don't
Let you go
And you
Let me go
When i and you let me go
So baby stay stay with me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Only You

[Intro]
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you

Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you

[Chorus]
And I'm coming back to you cause she don't understand
She don't wanna love, she is one other mess
She been moving steps like she wanna dance
Baby, I don't wanna be just friends

[Post-Chorus]
Can he treat you like a man?
Can he hold your hands and dance?
Baby, does he fake pretend?
Is he your number one fan?
Can he love like me?
Trust like me?
Fall like me?
Wait and see
What he claims to be
You and me, to the end, and to the eternity
[Verse 1]
And I'm drinkin' champagne and I'm pouring right it up in this cup
Baby, you got some problems, can you show me up?
And I always been the one to always show you love
And I climbed up all these mountains to put you above
Told me I was crazy for having a vision
Said I was the greatest, but you would never go listen
Yeah, I know I'm not the greatest but I can't be if I stay
Be inconsistent, if I stay makin' decisions that
Would take me to levels that I thought I couldn't reach
Maybe if I make some music with a message and a speech
Maybe I can be an idol, maybe I can go and teach, ay
Raise all these kids whose heads are stuck inside the streets

[Bridge]
I told you, if you feel the pain
Call me when you're feeling everything today
You don't want to show, you don't want to go
Everything you know
Is this how it is? It is?

[Verse 2]
She said that she wanna leave, I'm posting where the time at
Every time she talk to me, I'm asking are you mad yet?
Love it when you touch it, while I'm pushing down your spine back
To stickin' how I'm moving when you callin', I decline that
[Chorus]
And I'm coming back to you cause she don't understand
She don't wanna love, she is one other mess
She been moving steps like she wanna dance
Baby, I don't wanna be just friends

[Verse 3]
I put my trust in you, you put your trust in me
I should've known that you would end up leaving me
I cut too many tears for you, way too many times on you
Tell me all the things you do, but been through many fights for you
Remember all the times that we had
Baby, every time I met your laugh
Every time you fightin', I fight back
You know that I had your back
She knows, when she goes
Call my phone, let me know

[Outro]
Can you put your hand in mine?
[?]
Can you call me one more time?
Say that you are mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Confessions

[Verse 1]
You got everything that I want
So baby, won't you come with me?
We'll get through, through what he couldn't do
So tell me everything that I can do for you
Baby, I promise that no one will hurt you
As long as I am here right next to you
Tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
And I know what's been up on your mind
Baby, can I make you mine?
Promise I won't make you cry
Tonight

[Bridge]
[?]

[Verse 2]
And I know that you heart's been broke
I promise that you won't have to go to someone that you know
Even when I'm on the road, baby
Come and save me from all the things you see
Now, he wants you 'cause you're with me
Baby, why can't he let it be?
[Bridge]
Woah
Giving everything that you had [?]
But it's okay, I'm right hеre

[Verse 3]
And you know what is on my mind
Baby girl, you are hard to find
I won't evеr have to tell you twice
'Cause you know here what I'm feeling inside
Promise that there won't be promises
'Cause all my promises are prominent, girl
What's the point of even promising if
We ain't gonna keep our promises

[Chorus]
And I know what's been up on your mind
Baby, can I make you mine?
Promise I won't make you cry
Tonight

Song title: Miss me

[Chorus]
Say we cool but you don't even know me
And they gotta deal with me, I swear these bitches phoney
Say you told the truth but I’m the one who told me
Saying that you're different, you got loyalty, then show me
Baby, I lost my mind; baby, I'm hard to find
You think you got it all figured out, but you don’t know what you're missing

[Verse 1]
She been missing all my love, yeah, all the time
Told her I had enough and that she isn't mine
Yeah, she acting like that when I go recline
See her moving right back, you think I would decline
Yeah, timing, these bitches always put me in silence
Then they ask me why I am always so quiet
Yeah, I don't know
I've been chillin', moving quick with my head low

[Chorus]
Say we cool but you don't even know me
And they gotta deal with me, I swear these bitches phoney
Say you told the truth but I'm the one who told me
Saying that you’re different, you got loyalty, then show me
Baby, I lost my mind; baby, I’m hard to find
You think you got it all figured out, but you don't know what you’re missing
[Bridge]
I've been away
I don't know if you're staying with me tonight, with me tonight
So, won’t you stay with me tonight?
Please understand, but you don't wanna understand
So, all I fucking need is four nights ready for you to come back right to me
And she never learned to understand, she won't really ever understand

[Chorus]
Say we cool but you don't even know me
And they gotta deal with me, I swear these bitches phoney
Say you told the truth but I'm the one who told me
Saying that you're different, you got loyalty, then show me
Baby, I lost my mind; baby, I'm hard to find
You think you got it all figured out, but you don't know what you're missingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: On My Own

I got enemies
Don't you play with me
I done really did it all
Can't you really see
What I'm tryna be
I got all the keys
Opening up all these doors
So they set me free

Woah

You turned your fucking back on me
Now they sit and laugh on me
Now they wanna slack on me
Wanna clap for me
Baby I don't know

She been tipping, she been drinking
Can she call up my phone
Baby I know that you don't wanna go
Baby I hope that you know

I don't want no more questions no more problems
Baby it's not my job to go and solve em
Baby you gotta always let me know
Cause I won't stop guessing when I'm on the phone
Telling me what you need now
Baby I can't see now
Baby I can't breathe now

What you need for me
Baby you got love that you keep from me
I can see right through you
Yeah I'm on my knees
For you

Yeah, we safe and then sound
Baby are you around
I been heading straight to my dream but
All the noise been loud

Tell me what it is when I'm gone girl
Baby I don't really know why girl
You had to go and do me with your eyes
