Song title: Found What I’ve Been Looking For

[Verse 1]
Always fine lines between us
They say nowadays don't mean much
Cast an anchor in the sand, what we did
But my ship set sail and I’m here to tell that
I don’t mean like the others
And I…

[Chorus]
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for, yeah
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Should I wait, should I stay to see it
Unfold 'cause I’m told, I need it
I’m not frightened to take a step away
But my ship set sail and I’m here to tell that
I don’t mean like the others
And I…

[Chorus]
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for, yeah
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
[Bridge]
I’ve been running round, running round, running round
Now I’m down and out, down and out, down and out
Scared the magic might fade away

[Chorus]
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for

I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you noticed a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for, yeah
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)
Oooooooooh (found what I’ve been looking for, yeah)4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Something in the Water

[Chorus]
There's something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with you

[Verse 1]
I'm holding on to the past, my mother says I'm growing up fast
Oh time is gone with a blink
It's time to think and put your worries aside
Today is just today and tomorrow never dies
So never live on a regret
Take every moment you get and actions speak louder than words
So shout to the sky if your words can not be heard

[Chorus]
Something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with you

[Verse 2]
I'm wondering why my thoughts aren't clear
Am I hiding behind a crystal tear
Will the time stop before the dime drops
Will my foot print make the mark
Well I can see the light now as I'm stepping out the dark
[Chorus]
There's something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: I Might

[Verse 1]
Oh I love, oh I love, love my freedom
More than happy to be at a table for one
Go to a movie with just yours truly
Stay out all night or go to sleep early

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I do what I want to do
Got no one to answer to
Live whatever life I choose
I'm free

[Chorus]
Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it's no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might

[Verse 2]
Oh I like, oh I like singing loudly
In my room out of tune with no one around me
Being stupid, acting crazy
Work hard all day, I spend the day being lazy
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I go where I want to go
Living fast or taking it slow
Like it out here on my own
I'm free

[Chorus]
Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it’s no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might

[Bridge]
Might never walk away
Might beg you to stay
Might change everything just to keep you close to me

[Chorus]
Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it’s no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might, I might, I might
When you look at me like that
I might1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Little Bit of Love

[Chorus]
I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been countin' stars
And I'm sorry that I broke your heart
It's somethin' that I didn't want for you
But I'm steppin' on broken glass
And I know this is my final chance
All I'm tryna do is find my path to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

[Chorus]
I've been holdin' onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love
[Verse 2]
Lately, I've been wakin' up
In a dreamy state calling your name
Stayed up too late just thinkin' of you
Now I'm knocking on every door
'Cause I heard you moved from twenty-two
Has it been that long? I guess time just flew

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got voices in my head and there's a deafening silence
I've got voices in my head and I can't lie

[Chorus]
I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love

[Bridge]
I tried to fly but I used my wings too soon
Now everything got me thinking of you
I tried a million times to cut you loose
[Chorus]
I've been holding onto pieces, swimmin' in the deep end
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, I need a little love
Just like the air I'm breathin', these open wounds ain't healin'
Tryna find my way back to you 'cause I'm needin'
A little bit of love
A little bit of love, a little bit of love, a little bit of love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Sober

[Verse 1]
The way you stand there in your three striped shell toes and
The way your hair dances, it's clear you want all eyes on you
It's all eyes on you
And though I know that I won't get no answers, I
I just can't stop from indulging my lean eyes on you
My fool eyes on you

[Pre-Chorus]
As you dance on the burning coals
I feel the bullet holes
Tell myself I've got nothing to lose
Though your touch gives me vertigo, I'm like a domino
Darling I keep falling back to you

[Chorus]
But if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
Why do you stop me getting sober?

[Verse 2]
You leave your sweet bitter taste under my tongue and
You leave your smoke to seep deep into my lungs
I know how you're taking hold
My love is wasted, somehow you laced it
And I'm on my knees
There's no remedy
[Pre-Chorus]
As you dance on the burning coals
I feel the bullet holes
Tell myself I've got nothing to lose
Though your touch gives me vertigo, I'm like a domino
Darling I keep falling back to you

[Chorus]
But if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
Why do you stop me getting sober?

[Bridge]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na

[Chorus]
But if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
So if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?
You pull me closer
You say you miss the way I hold ya
I feel you breathing on my shoulder
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na na)
Why do you stop me getting sober?
(Na na na, na na na
Na na na na)
Why do you stop me getting sober?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Sweet Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
My eyes are delusional
And I'm not thinking the same
But I've been wondering:
Is it me you're looking for

[Verse 2]
Well you'll find me standing on these cold streets
Hoping that you're looking for a little bit more
Will you catch me, save me when I'm falling?
Tell me have you ever been here before?

[Chorus]
So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage and find your lion
And if you hear the angel sings
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
So many faces telling the story
Like once upon a time
Blinded by the force of falling in love or
Leaving it all behind.. but
The fear of the unknown, and who to follow
Leaves me howling at the skies
[Pre-Chorus]
Is there a purpose in what we believe?
Well I will continue to wear my heart upon my sleeves

[Chorus]
So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage, find your lion
And take your pride and leave the past
Set sail for new horizons

So take my hand and lead the way
Find your courage and find your lion
And if you hear the angel sings
Sweet Hallelujah
Hallelujah1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Praying

[Verse 1]
I've walked through hell, and I've battled the storms
I know too well how, it feels when you fall

[Verse 2]
I'm on this road, and I won't' lose my faith
Pack it up, pack it up, 'cause I'm on my way
For so long....

[Chorus]
I've been praying, for a brighter day
I've been praying, trying to find my way
Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

[Verse 3]
I've over due, just a little bit of luck
I get the taste, but its never enough
I'm on this road
And I won't lose my faith
Pack it up, pack it up cause I'm on my way
For so long....

[Chorus]
I've been praying for a brighter day
I've been praying trying to find my way
Time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying
[Verse 4]
On my own, I search high and low
Till I find what I've been looking for
I'm in my deep end and I won't be beaten till I find what I've been praying for...

[Chorus]
I've been praying, for a brighter day
I've been praying, trying to find my way
Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

[Verse 5]
I keep praying
I keep praying
Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1]
Come be my lover, be my get away car
Come be the new string on my broken guitar
Be the person, gotta take it that one step too far, whoa

You’re acting like you wanna show if I’m right
If you’re feeling what I’m feeling

Song title: Barbed Wire

[Verse 1]
Young man, but wise to the bone
From a youthless man who’s walked a lonely road
And no fear of picking up Daddy’s traits
He holds himself together with these barbed wire gates

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone, we stand together we fall
Slow, that belief conquers all

[Chorus]
So don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
I say, don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire

[Verse 2]
And watch him grow into a shell of a man
Everything is taking shape and going to plan
How quickly though, life can turn around
One step forward, two steps back, he’s lost in the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone, we stand together we fall
Slow, that belief conquers all
[Chorus]
So don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
I say, don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire

[Bridge]
If you walk in your shadow
Led by shepherds then you know
If you walk in your shadow
If you walk in your shadow
Led by shepherds then you know
If you walk in your shadow

[Chorus]
So don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
I say, don’t let people hold you back
Gotta stand tall and aim higher
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire
Don’t touch the barbed wire2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: This Is The Age

[Verse 1]
They say a king ain’t a king without his rubies and gold
But I know kings with little things and by god does he have it all
It’s not in dimes that defines the way a man should show his love
Take the time to read between the lines

[Pre]
Because Rome wasn’t built in a day
And patience is the only way

[Chorus]
This is the age of the lost and the found
And now raise a glass to those who choose to live without
And don’t need no king for a castle or a ticket to the stars
So close your eyes and know how lucky you are
So close your eyes and know how lucky you are

[Verse 2]
Now that we’ve sung and you know you’re not the only one to see behind the truth
The ceremonial dispute of love and hate and war and games
Before them white horses come galloping, you’re battling
Don’t forget to read between the lines

[Pre]
Because Rome wasn’t built in a day
And patience is the only way
[Chorus]
This is the age of the lost and the found
And now raise a glass to those who choose to live without
And don’t need no king for a castle or a ticket to the stars
So close your eyes and know how lucky you are
So close your eyes and know how lucky you are

[Outro]
This is the age, this is the age
This is the age, this is the age
So close your eyes and know how lucky you are1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
