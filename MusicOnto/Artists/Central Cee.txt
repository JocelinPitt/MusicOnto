Song title: Loading

[Intro]
(HARGO Production)

[Chorus]
Cee don't be on the road too tough
But I still cut through with the local thugs (Thugs)
Coulda ran off the plug
But I kept it real and I showed him love (Showed him love)
Lil'-lil' bro got the poker tucked
Where we grow up, it's so corrupt
Fans see me on the block, go nuts
I'm not in my bag, I'm loading, loading
Back then, it was hand-to-hand
Nowadays, I don't have no involvement
In the trap, I'll stay on my own
I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
WhyJay no commented it
It's complicated, 'cause the case still open
The boys in blue tryna find them clues
In the station, problem-solving

[Verse 1]
Bro just jumped out the ride with a mask on, face likе he dodging COVID (Bah)
Jumped off the porch and wеnt my own way, no way, I don't owe no olders (No way)
Free all the guys and rest in peace to all of the fallen soldiers
The world full up of impactive distractions so we all lose focus (Haha)
I think out loud, what comes out my mouth, I can't control it
Live Yours on the chain, I'm so lit, soon come out with the custom clothing
Fuck sake, you must be joking, CIDs outside of the cut, patrollin'
How-how did they know 'bout the ins and outs? Somebody must've told 'em
[Chorus]
Cee don't be on the road too tough
But I still cut through with the local thugs (Thugs)
Could've ran off the plug
But I kept it real and I showed him love (Showed him love)
Lil'-lil' bro got the poker tucked (Tucked)
Where we grow up, it's so corrupt (So corrupt)
Fans see me on the block, go nuts
I'm not in my bag, I'm loading, loading
Back then, it was hand-to-hand
Nowadays, I don't have no involvement
In the trap, I'll stay on my own
I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
WhyJay no commented it
It's complicated, 'cause the case still open
The boys in blue tryna find them clues
In the station, problem-solving

[Verse 2]
Cee don't do no fraud, I trap, say "Yo" to the local cat (Yo)
See me on the road, all black
My foot on the gas and I won't fall back
Bro been in a jail and he won't go back
I fucked bare hoes and they ain't all that
I'm missing their call and I won't phone back
It's time that I find me a wife
More time, I don't have no type
But I wouldn't mind me a Liyah Mai (Okay)
Treat her right, I'd try (Alright)
Finer things in life, I'd buy (Okay)
Wanna wine and dine, that's fine
If we go uptown, gotta hold that (Whoosh)
Wanna fly Dubai tonight? Lastminute.com, I'll book that flight
[Chorus]
Cee don't be on the road too tough
But I still cut through with the local thugs (Thugs)
Could've ran off the plug
But I kept it real and I showed him love (Showed him love)
Lil'-lil' bro got the poker tucked
Where we grow up, it's so corrupt
Fans see me on the block, go nuts
I'm not in my bag, I'm loading, loading
Back then, it was hand-to-hand
Nowadays, I don't have no involvement
In the trap, I'll stay on my own
I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
WhyJay no commented it

Song title: Commitment Issues

[Intro]
(Mokuba)

[Chorus]
I got commitment issues but I'm tryna fix that for you
If I can’t afford that bag that you want then I would lick that for you, huh
I wanna be there for you, I knew that the day I saw you
Too many times we argue, sorry for all of the names I called you
Shoulda never called you a bitch but I did, now you're pissed, tryna cut my clothes (Don't do that)
Should have deleted that text, then you wouldn’t have known that I fucked those hoes (Alright)
Don't act like you care how I feel, don't act like you care how I feel, you don't
Don't like how you act so spoilt, you start move mad when I tell you "No"

[Verse 1]
But I wanna make it known (Alright)
I gotta take my time with love, so we gotta take it slow (Tek time)
I'm not used to this type of stuff but I can still make you moan (Anytime)
Anytime that you want, I can lay that (Lay that)
You wait on the day that I say "I love you too" but I just can't say that (Say that)
You want that bag, I'ma hit that trap, in a week I’ll make that purchase (I’ll buy that)
One touch make her leg start shake, make her legs start shake like I make you nervous
Every time that I rap 'bout hoes, I know that you hate those lyrics
I don’t believe in love but that doesn't mean I don't take you serious

[Chorus]
I got commitment issues but I'm tryna fix that for you
If I can’t afford that bag that you want then I would lick that for you, huh
I wanna be there for you, I knew that the day I saw you
Too many times we argue, sorry for all of the names I called you
Shoulda never called you a bitch but I did, now you're pissed, tryna cut my clothes (Don't do that)
Should have deleted that text, then you wouldn't have known that I fucked those hoes (Alright)
Don't act like you care how I feel, don't act like you care how I feel, you don't
Don't like how you act so spoilt, you start move mad when I tell you "No"
[Verse 2]
I got commitment issues (I do)
I know that your ex still miss you (I know)
You can't get enough of my love 'cause I give you a fuck that your ex can't give you, ha
Send the location (Skrrt), I'm speeding 'cause I got no patience
Twenty bags on trainers, think I'm famous, I got a lot of hoes though lately (Ah)
I get a lot of dough though lately, and I get paid on the promo lately
A lot of fake love in the air, can't go nowhere on my solo lately
Me and her just argue daily, she knows that I trap so her marge don't rate me
When I don't text back, I ain't with a yat, I'm in the bando, baby

[Chorus]
I got commitment issues but I'm tryna fix that for you
If I can't afford that bag that you want then I would lick that for you, huh
I wanna be there for you, I knew that the day I saw you
Too many times we argue, sorry for all of the names I called you
Shoulda never called you a bitch but I did, now you're pissed, tryna cut my clothes (Don't do that)
Should have deleted that text, then you wouldn't have known that I fucked those hoes (Alright)
Don't act like you care how I feel, don't act like you care how I feel, you don't
Don't like how you act so spoilt, you start move mad when I tell you "No"8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Day in the Life

[Intro]
(Strikes in the mix)

[Chorus]
Day in the life
Let's see if you really trap
Turn off the autotune
Let's hear how you really rap
Haha, send a location
Come burn a boy if you're bad, let's see
Your dad left home from young
And you ain't done shit for your mum, ah man, ah man
How are you relying on man like gyal?
You're mad, you mas'a mad
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
Can't keep track, been in the trap
It's hard, I can't keep up (I can't keep up)
Selling them party drugs
I'm the one that got the party turnt

[Verse 1]
Everyone say they T (They T)
Fascinated by the trap
I might put the bando on Airbnb (B)
Leave me a good review, next time you come
Get some, get one for free (Who's that?)
Who's that with the hair on fleek?
She made me beep my horn, it's peak
I try stay low in the Jeep, low-key (Discrete)
The feds ain't dumb, they know wagwan
But the young G's too naive
Little bro got nicked two times this week
Freedom's priceless, not cheap
Fuck you, pay me
Got a booking fee plus VAT (VAT)
R.I.P. A1, it's sad that he didn't see eighteen
[Chorus]
Day in the life
Let's see if you really trap
Turn off the autotune
Let's hear how you really rap
Haha, send a location
Come burn a boy if you're bad, let's see
Your dad left home from young
And you ain't done shit for your mum, ah man, ah man
How are you relying on man like gyal?
You're mad, you mas'a mad
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
Can't keep track, been in the trap
It's hard, I can't keep up (I can't keep up)
Selling them party drugs
I'm the one that got the party turnt

[Verse 2]
Bro said I'm going all dumb
I won't leave that trap alone
Come like I'm young in love
Got a toxic relationship with Stacey, but she won't cut me off
Can't be breaking even no more, brodie, I must see prof'
Came to the bando healthy, left with a dusty cough
Loving the goldest rose like the England rugby top
These bitches lie, relationship advice, don't trust these thots
Everyone talk gun 'pon beat, but in their real life, no gun beat off
Keep the convo brief, say no more, my G
Don't you know that talk is cheap?
Like my gyaldem short and sweet
What ya mean can you sit on my face? She listen to too much DBE
Everyone got PTSD, how come everyone now sip on lean?
Don't you know that I grind two fours? I'm on two-fours like Christmas Eve
Bro, why you act surprise? I told you dis and you didn't believe
Can deal with the trap being dirty, can't deal with the dirty D's
If the yard I'm in gets spun, I won't come home 'til I'm thirty-three
[Chorus]
Day in the life
Let's see if you really trap
Turn off the autotune
Let's hear how you really rap
Haha, send a location
Come burn a boy if you're bad, let's see
Your dad left home from young
And you ain't done shit for your mum, ah man, ah man
How are you relying on man like gyal?
You're mad, you mas'a mad
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag
Can't keep track, been in the trap
It's hard, I can't keep up (I can't keep up)
Selling them party drugs
I'm the one that got the party turnt

[Outro]
You ain't never sat in the trap with a pack
Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag

Hear the doorbell ring and your heartbeat lag), Frosty7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Obsessed With You

[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Your hair's under my pillow so I sleep (So I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (Nastylgia, At my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)

[Chorus: Central Cee & PinkPantheress]
I hope a trap boy's your type (Why?)
'Cause I don't have a 9-to-5 (Alright)
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (Literally)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line
I'll switch it (Calm)
You said you don't like my life, you said you don't like my guys
You're trippin' (When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me?)

[Bridge: PinkPantheress & Central Cee]
I followed you, I followed you today, I was in my car (Alright)
I wanted to come see you from afar (At my feet)
If you turned around and saw me I would die
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me?

[Verse: Central Cee]
Bad one and she photogenic (Alright)
Instagram got a lot of impressions (Uh-huh)
She think I'm a G and I don't need love
But I need some thug affection (Literally)
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
Man I got 21 questions (Like 50)
In the trap with the cats, domestics
She doin' lashes, somethin' cosmetic
They shot their shot, she read it
They slid in DM with somethin' generic (Huh)
She don't even like goin' out
Got a new outfit, but nowhere to wear it (Alright)
She think that I'm being disloyal when I'm in the streets with couple of killys
(You ain't gotta) You ain't gotta worry 'bout none of these hoes
I'm grown, I'm done with these bitches (Done with these bitches, done with these bitches)
[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress]
Your hair's under my pillow so I sleep (So I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (At my feet)
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)

[Chorus: Central Cee & PinkPatheress]
I hope a trap boy's your type (Why?)
'Cause I don't have a 9-to-5 (Alright)
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different (Literally)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line
I'll switch it (Calm)
You said you don't like my life, you said you don't like my guys
You're trippin'

[Outro: Central Cee & PinkPantheress]
Wipe them just for me? Me, me, me, me
I hope a trap boy's your type
Do you wipe them just for me? Me, me, me, me
I get that your standards high
But I'm not a random guy, I'm different
I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)
When I write my rhymes, you say you don't like that line
I'll switch it (Calm)
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for—9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: 6 for 6

[Intro]
Living my life as a lie
And the sun keeps falling down
Living my life as a lie
And the sun keeps falling down
You are now listening to Young Chencs
Put in the work for years for this, this ain't no coincidence
Back then when I weren't so lit, now I'm lit, they're pissed

[Chorus]
Bad B's, they curved the kid
Back then when I weren't so lit, now I'm lit, they're pissed
Told bro-bro that you gotta' take it slow
But he knows crime pays, so he won't go lidge'
Went three-for-three, now I'm six-for-six
Put in the work for years for this, this ain't no coincidence
I did have to take thеm trips

[Verse 1]
Shit, they're talkin' shit and it makes mе sick
I said "fuck school" and it made me rich
We did sell crack on an 80's ting
The jakes on us and they pray we slip
Said "fuck school" and I broke the law
Told little bro "gotta' stay in school"
Tellin' the kids this shit ain't cool, fuck, I'm so hypocritical
Fuck, I just missed a call
My bro's in the field, not volleying balls
Sold cocaine, and molly, and all
Told mumzy don't worry at all
Step in the bando, "Honey, I'm home"
The local fiends don't vouch
He won't get served, the cats unknown
I don't owe no-one, made money alone
[Chorus]
Bad B's, they curved the kid
Back then when I weren't so lit, now I'm lit, they're pissed
Told bro-bro that you gotta' take it slow
But he knows crime pays, so he won't go lidge'
Went three-for-three, now I'm six-for-six
Put in the work for years for this, this ain't no coincidence
I did have to take them trips

[Verse 2]
Could've been in the bin if it weren't for the gloves that I had when I wrapped that rizz
That kid got nicked on an amateur ting
Gotta bank that cling, take precaution
If you knew the risks we took to get paid, you wouldn’t look at me the same
My bro got the wickedest aim
We’re bringing the blicky on stage
They're hating I'm really unfazed (Haha)
Don't test my patience
Half of the hood did show man love, it's bait that the rest are hating
Now I got gyal all around, still, my wild from the west my favourite
These cats are domesticated, jakes in the station investigating

[Chorus]
Bad B's, they curved the kid
Back then when I weren't so lit, now I'm lit, they're pissed
Told bro-bro that you gotta' take it slow
But he knows crime pays, so he won't go lidge'
Went three-for-three, now I'm six-for-six
Put in the work for years for this, this ain't no coincidence
I did have to take them trips
Bad B's, they curved the kid
Back then when I weren't so lit, now I'm lit, they're pissed
Told bro-bro that you gotta' take it slow
But he knows crime pays, so he won't go lidge'
Went three-for-three, now I'm six-for-six
Put in the work for years for this, this ain't no coincidence
I did have to take them trips8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Molly

[Intro]
Strikes in the mix
Ghosty
I-I-I Love Chris Rich

[Chorus]
Gyal wanna come round 'ere
And them boy round dere too bummy
And we get money
Dem man broke, that's a joke
It's not even funny
Can't answer the phone
I'm with my side ting, now my main ting worried
Jeet and skeet, I'ma call right back
I just seen your missed call, I'm sorry
Put my mum through too much drama
Maybe I shoulda went colly
Too much time in the trap
But now, when I shop, I fill that trolley
On the field, I do it like Costa
Get that assist, I hit that volley
I'm the reason the party tu'nt
I was the one giving out Molly

[Verse 1]
All this label talk is draining
Got A&Rs acting friendly
Trynna get me to sign these papers
Man said 21 wiva mill
I need the same deal as Aitch's
What the fuck do you mean 'bout "twenty bags"?
I spent that shit on trainers
What the fuck do you mean 'bout "a hundred bags"?
Huh? Take your pen back
Why you talking shit?
I'm not dissing DBE blud, I'm rating dem man
I'm just not really rating the following ting
Going on right now, I'm a leader
Can't lie, it's 'bout time that they took me in
Spend 'bout 5 years in the T house
But, the hard work pays off
Na, I can't take days off
Lotta man got things to say
Remember, the talk don't cost
I got what the rappers got
I don't even rap a lot
Too clean, I'm immaculate
You wouldn't think I'm in the trap a lot
Fulls deep in a bitch, I'm all in
No bowling, free yard, who's rolling?
Who's that wida back, wait, hold on
Mandem way in the back just scoping
She's liking my recent posts
Send that post-code, I'm roasting
All I do is make money, I'm boring
South parked up, now I'm just postponing
[Chorus]
Gyal wanna come round 'ere
And them boy round dere too bummy
And we get money
Dem man broke, that's a joke
It's not even funny
Can't answer the phone
I'm with my side ting, now my main ting worried
Jeet and skeet, I'ma call right back
I just seen your missed call, I'm sorry
Put my mum through too much drama
Maybe I shoulda went colly
Too much time in the trap
But now, when I shop, I fill that trolley
On the field, I do it like Costa
Get that assist, I hit that volley
I'm the reason the party tu'nt
I was the one giving out Molly

[Verse 2]
I'm the reason the party lit
Trynna squeeze four tings in the whip at Lib
She bad, gonna shake that back for the vid
Bad bitch gonna make that trip for the kid
Cute one in the hood like Rich
Boujee one in SW6
See the camera flash, no wait
Cover my face, I don't wanna be in your pic
Didn't show that hoe no love
Now she wanna set me up
All 'cause I fucked and ducked, didn't call her back
Now she wanna see man get touched
The life I live's all nuts
Think I'm mad, you should meet my pups
Ain't been with the gang as much
One up in the cut with the grub, no fuss
[Chorus]
Gyal wanna come round 'ere
And them boy round dere too bummy
And we get money
Dem man broke, that's a joke
It's not even funny
Can't answer the phone
I'm with my side ting, now my main ting worried
Jeet and skeet, I'ma call right back
I just seen your missed call, I'm sorry
Put my mum through too much drama
Maybe I shoulda went colly
Too much time in the trap

Song title: Pinging (6 Figures)

[Intro]
(Itchy, is that how you're goin' on, yeah?)

[Chorus]
Take that risk and go independent, I just turned down six figures (Get different)
On the phone you was loud, now we're in real life and you're soundin' timid (Quiet)
The young bulls cheff and swing it, the kids these days aren't down for swingings
Sellin' them party drugs, I'm the one that got the party pinging (I'm the one that...)

[Verse 1]
That boy got caught out slippin' by the popo and he started singin' (Oh no)
These days I've been feeling different, on my solo, I don't need no bring in
Why them man therе chasing bitches? I put in the work, I don't need no women
Thеy don't wanna see me in my bag, they're pissed that I keep on winning
They used to sleep on my ting, put in the work and I keep on grinding
Got my cake up, I paid it straight up, I defo don't need co-signing (Nah)
Demon time, I'm movin' quiet, I'm pouring up lean in Sprite
We invest in white and turn on lines, you boys just been online

[Chorus]
Take that risk and go independent, I just turned down six figures (Get different)
On the phone you was loud, now we're in real life and you're soundin' timid (Quiet)
The young bulls cheff and swing it, the kids these days aren't down for swingings
Sellin' them party drugs, I'm the one that got the party pinging (I'm the one that)

[Verse 2]
I just heard a knock on the door, it's six in the morn' and my heartbeat's skipping (Who's that?)
Feds in the crib G-checking, they're askin' questions, my madre trippin' (Ah shit)
I'm screamin' "Free all of my ones locked", fuck it, the clock keep tickin'
Imagine we grew near an OT spot, I think that a lot would be different
They're calling, I gotta be quick, I'm bagging up yay and a lottery ticket
I can't trust man that chat like gyal, I'm thinkin' they're probably snitches
I don't wanna play things safe, nine times out of ten, I'd probably risk it
They're showin' me love right now but if I was broke they'd probably switch it
[Chorus]
Take that risk and go independent, I just turned down six figures (Get different)
On the phone you was loud, now we're in real life and you're soundin' timid (Quiet)
The young bulls cheff and swing it, the kids these days aren't down for swingings
Sellin' them party drugs, I'm the one that got the party pinging (I'm the one that)

[Verse 3]
They try cramp my style, I turn back 'round on a quick re-route
Bad B wanna eat uptown, I'm too laid back, she can't figure me out
Don't make me waste my time, if I come out, is it worth my while?
I don't wanna hear no Samsung ring, I don't wanna hear that sound (Huh)
The kids these days don't care about gettin' a bag, they just care about clout (How?)
In the trap tryna run up that bag, they're out there tryna run man down
If you get caught with grub, good luck, they're not tryna hear man out
Free D Roy out the pound, they're all tryna send him down

[Chorus]
Take that risk and go independent, I just turned down six figures (Get different)
On the phone you was loud, now we're in real life and you're soundin' timid (Quiet)
The young bulls cheff and swing it, the kids these days aren't down for swingings
Sellin' them party drugs, I'm the one that got the party pinging (I'm the one that)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Mad About Bars

Part 1

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
You ready for another spoiler?
I've always been a man of bold predictions
And I'm predicting that this guy right here; star in the making
Coming outta' West London, some of you may know the name
But for those who don't, it's my guy, Central Cee

[Verse: Central Cee]
If you've got what it takes I'll take it
This shit took ages
Should know that you can't rush greatness
But you're too impatient
One million views ain't famous
Need me a crib no neighbours, mad
Need me a thousand acres
Can't wait til a mans on stages
I'm just not at that stage yet
Million views I'm grateful, love
Broski thinks that I've made it
Whats the long term vision?
2 m in my daughter's saving
Cats fell back and I thought he fainted
Dirty trap, hope the jakes don't raid it
This when I took that L
I thought 'bout jail and I stopped complaining
Don't know 'bout drought
Spoke to the plug just now and a lot just came in
Bro's over the pot just whipping
You know that the plot just twisting
Bro done a whole lot of missions
Meanwhile, whole of your block just bitching
So it don't make sense
Selling them party drugs, why'd you think that I'm up, 4 am
Link my shqipe for the rawest yay
Don't you know that talk is bait?
Same way bro caught that case
When I make 10 m might call it a day
I was young and I still invested
Cah I'm business minded
Stay in the trap or rap, or both, I'm indecisive
I was bando sofa surfing
Observe, I over heard 'em
One sign I'll burn that bridge, might go left if I miss this turning
Can't make my mind up, I'm in two minds
Not once did I think 'bout quitting, I always knew that I'd blow due time
I always knew that hoe weren't mine (ha, ha)
I always knew them boys won't ride (real shit)
Why'd you think that I rode on my own more time
Let the game commence
I'm up front, they play on the bench
I heard who's up next?, the city been saying it's Cench (Cench)
Tell a friend, tell a friend to tell a friend
I been on some bullshit I'm sure its evident
Deep down I'm hurt, I'm stressing, but with the guys I'm fried, I'm laughing
When it comes to riding round there stalling bare mm-ing and argh-ing
See Wazz pull up in a foreign, who's calling and who's it regarding
Dumb hoe just called me a wrong, I'm common so what's so alarming
Bare hands I reckon I'd fist 'em but the pussy 'oles start backing out kitchens
Bro back in the can didn't listen
Hand full of bands in abandoned building
If the fans don't feel this
I'll be back in the bando filming
Baby I'm board on the dinger had to tell b I don't have no children
I'm not in the mood for pics, Im hearing kids saying swear that's him
They know the songs I sing, they don't know the life I live
They talk 'bout riding, they don't know 'bout the violent side of things
They see me shining, they don't know 'bout the grind that I put in (Woo)
Part 2

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
Aye, Cench, let's be real though
2020's been a fucked up year so far
And more time, don't even look like there's light at the end of the tunnel
'Nuff unanswered questions, and I need someone to speak on it
And who better than yourself? Free the man cuz

[Verse: Central Cee]
Tough times don't last
When's the pain gonna pass
I seen older fall of and order one light, one dark
I won't talk too much, and put that boy on blast
They call me 23 but this ain't no last dance
CEO im renowned
For staying months in that town
I'm not welcome in my house my mum abandoned her child
Before they try and take my chain and pull there cameras out
Imagine beefing with a brudda on a random account
Turn the news on, ain't nothing informative though
I'm over it now, I'm sure that this corona's a hoax
The less we know, fam it's like the more they control
If all of us spoke, then I'm pretty sure we'd evolve
Importing that dough, my brodie dodged the border control
They gave my brudda eight years for the caller info
Had to revoke, then I started seeing results
I wonder who's getting called, when MPs won't cope, huh
Nobody showed me love when I was grinding but it's changed
Whenever I'm around them they all smiling but it's fake
If music don't cut it then the grind is gonna pay
I be ghosting all the time, I disappear, hibernate
All the women that I fuck with say im suttin' else
Cause I put money first and I don't really trust these girls
Had to put a penny on it, I don't trust those girls
In the trap house with my brother doing top and tales
This ain't for the fake or the small minded
Small circle, violate we all riding
I got vision, this ain't for the short sighted
Free the guys and this ain't for the law abiding
I'm from a city full of skyscrapers
Armed feds, X5s, high speed chases
Now they wanna help I don't need your favours
When I needed help I couldn't see faces
Wanna see me fail and demotivated
I ain't fucking with no rappers they ain't no relation
I was losing hope, planning home invasions
I'm only involved in money conversations
Fuck a generation gap I relate to the masses
I don't even need to drill I could pay for the action
Central persister and I'm too reluctant
I remember I was broke, had to learn to ration
It was fun while it lasted now its my turn
Chopping down the onion make your eyes burn
I was putting work in when them guys weren't
I'm flying straight they Tryna make me divertEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Ruby

[Intro: Foreigner]
Sykes-Sykes
You're as cold as Ice
Nostalgia

[Verse 1]
Ruby's as cold as ice, what she's been through in her life ain't right
Mum and dad the addicted type, she was in care by the age of five
She moved out to the Isle of Wight, she moved four times by the time she was nine
She don't trust no guys, they gotta get through but they keep on trying
Ruby don't act her age, she fifteen but grown and wise
Fake love can't heal the pain, she don't go school, she smoke, get high
Her parents smoking white, how can I judge how you cope with life?
Chilling with older guys, they asked her age, she told them lies
You know what it's like, you know how it goes
She's young and she lost her virginity, now everyone call her a hoe
Started with problems at home, now all of the sudden the problem has grown
But Ruby grew up on her own, she don't have a problem with being alone

[Chorus: Foreigner, Central Cee]
You're as cold as ice (These roads are as cold as ice)
You're willing to sacrifice (If you don't wanna freeze, best stay inside)
You're as cold as ice (Take that chance, roll the dice)
You're willing to sacrifice (Broken hearts, broken homes, you're not from here, you won't know what it's like)

[Verse 2]
Jack's as cold as ice, he's lost his mum and most his guys
Way too young but holding knives, he'll do that crime with no disguise
Retaliation how you cope with pride, no hesitating, go on a ride
You roll the dice, if it goes to plan then calm, if it don't you di-
Don't gamble your life, you don't get that twice
I don't think I'll ever let that slide but I won't get dough when I get that stripe, we get the worst advice
Think that you're bad 'til you're locked in a can and now you wanna turn to Christ
It costs to be a boss but death ain't worth that price
Jack got caught with a shank and Jakes linked him to a local murder
Jack's eighteen and his co-d's Max, he's young so he's moving nervous
Jack been in the station multiple times, he's moving quiet on purpose
Max kept it quiet aswell, now they're both in jail and they just got birded
[Chorus: Foreigner, Central Cee]
You're as cold as ice (These roads are as cold as ice)
You're willing to sacrifice (If you don't wanna freeze, best stay inside)
You're as cold as ice (Take that chance, roll the dice)
You're willing to sacrifice (Broken hearts, broken homes, you're not from here, you won't know what it's like)

[Verse 3: Central Cee]
The roads as cold as ice, you're not from here, you won't know what it's like
TV shows don't show what it's like, I've seen it with my own two eyes
Two sides, you'll see the divide, freedom of speech, I'm speaking my mind
Saying too much, get disqualified, get fed to the lions, eat you alive
Grew in a detrimental place, deteriorating your mental state
It's all good 'cause we still kept faith
Making it work but we still want change
These days, it's all fabricated
Got to the point being real looks fake
Th-The fiends don't have no shame
Crackheads smoke crack where the children play
You know this, it's all a bit strange
Showbiz 'cause they all look staged
Selfishness is a foolish game
It would all change if it's all at stake
This ain't just for the gang, I feel like we all can relate
On my side, we're all the same, my hood don't discriminate

[Chorus: Foreigner, Central Cee]
You're as cold as ice (These roads are as cold as ice)
You're willing to sacrifice (If you don't wanna freeze, best stay inside)
You're as cold as ice (Take that chance, roll the dice)
You're willing to sacrifice (Broken hearts, broken homes, you're not from here, you won't know what it's like)
[Outro: Foreigner, Central Cee]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice, You're not from here, you won't know-3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Fraud

[Intro]
We Jammin'
Who made this? JB made this
Yo

[Verse 1]
Was young, try bang an AC, I tried a ting and they blocked my card
Oh lard, I trap but it ain't that smart cah bro done half an M of fraud
Get bun in the name of trust, I'm too paranoid, can't drop my guard
Couldn't believe they locked my darg, I feel it for him, and it hurt me hard
What's ours is ours, on your marks, get ready and go, I won't come last
I'm charged, I'll do what I need to do but I won't suck ass
I had to stay at my bredrin's yard, they didn't think that I'd come this far
One-shot to shine, I'll close my eyes, if I get one chance, I'll hit the target
Fresh out the trap, my song just charted, ain't even started, I'm not in my bag
When you step into town, gotta pull up your pants, fam, pull up your pants, don't sag
Ain't serving no random cat, bro got sеnt can, and he came home tappеd
It ain't no cap, I'm the hardest out, even they know that

[Chorus]
Let me talk my shit, still walk my strip
I bought my whip and I ran mileage up and I took that trip
Let me talk my shit, still walk my strip
I bought my whip and I ran mileage up and I took that trip

[Verse 2]
I don't chat shit when I come on the mic, I just won't waste my breath
I don't say nothing under my breath that I won't say with my chest
Bad B wanna lay in my bed, my bad but I gotta go chase that bread
I just misplaced this weight, one sec, I gotta retrace my steps
Who's up next? They're saying it's Cench
What's the odds? Place your bets
Just made a name this year, pushed man outta the way this year
They show so much love, it's weird I have a feeling I'll go this clear next year
I need the same deal that my man got, I had a meeting and I made it clear
Not long till I'm out of here, funny feeling in the atmosphere
I'm sorry Mary I had to interfere, I got a reload, can I bag this here?
My amigo gonna volunteer, we're the trio, we're the musketeers
More time I'm emotionless, it's been a while now since I bussed a tear
[Chorus]
Let me talk my shit, still walk my strip
I bought my whip and I ran mileage up and I took that trip
Let me talk my shit, still walk my strip
I bought my whip and I ran mileage up and I took that trip
Let me talk my shit, still walk my strip
I bought my whip and I ran mileage up and I took that trip
Let me talk my shit, still walk my strip
I bought my whip and I ran mileage up and I took that trip

[Outro]
Let me talk my shit, still walk my stripEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
