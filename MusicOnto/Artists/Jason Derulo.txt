Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks

Saying "Oh, we all together singing"

[Chorus]
Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Ready the people
A new day has just begun
And I wear my colors on my back (celebrate, celebrate)
We're created equal
One race, and that's human
Can't wait til they all see, all see dat
[Pre-Chorus]
Saying "Oh, can't you taste the feeling, feeling"
Saying "Oh, we all together singing"

[Chorus]
Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now (there's beauty)
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
One hand, two hands for your colors
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Show your true colors

[Bridge]
Here we go, eh oh eh oh (here we go)
Let's put on a show, eh oh eh oh (let's put on a show right now now)
Let me see your hands up
Let me see your hands up
Here we go, eh oh eh oh
[Chorus]
Look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now
There's beauty in the unity we've found
I'm ready, I'm ready
We still got a long way
But look how far we've come
Now, now, now, now, now
Hands up for your colors
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's beauty in the unity we've found
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
One hand, two hands for your colors
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's beauty in the unity we've found
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Show your true colors

[Outro]
Here we go, eh oh eh oh (here we go)
Let's put on a show, eh oh eh oh
Hands up for your colors
Represent your country
