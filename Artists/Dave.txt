Song title: Thiago Silva

[Intro]
1-6-6

[Verse 1: Dave]
Santan from the V-V x AJ
Man mystic with the pen like J.K
True say, I ain't really a drinker
But I got love for brandy like Ray J
Champagne popper, .44 chopper
In a black Nike bomber, heartbeat stopper
Half-heart MC dropper
.45 wapper, leave you in the states like Kaká

[Verse 2: AJ Tracey]
AJ from the l-l x Santan
Man's got style on the riddim like Gangnam
Two young bruddas tryna eat off of music
But we used to eat off of pebs and the sand bags
Now we get money, music money
Money that could put your girlfriend in a handbag
White tee, Balenciagas, man bag
Left-winger with a long stick like a granddad
AJ Tizzy from T-H-E lizzy
And I'm all out for the Lizzy
I don't wanna look like you, you're broke
And I've been telling broke bruddas "move" like Grizzy
Still brandy but the hand ting fizzy
Probs be in bin if a man weren't busy
I'm a mic king, I'm a king on the mic
And I'll spin bruddas til the whole scene gets dizzy
[Hook: Dave & AJ Tracey]
Walk in the rave, smile on my face
Drink in my cup, hand in my jeans
Man talk tough, man look up, down, left, right
Straight to a bang in the teeth
Man still talk tough, man saw man in the flesh
Now man's tryna talk to my Gs
Nah, none of that, none, .45 drum
Run you right out of your street
Walk in the dance, chicks wanna glance
Hand on my hip, shank for the dip
If I shout "oi", them man there best skip
Better tie up your laces tight and don't trip
Trip, get splashed
Couldn't care less about my man's gang
We're not fam, we're not friends or bredrins
You'll get tanned and binned, cock, then blam

[Verse 3: Dave]
Santan Dave from the Vale and Tracey
Duck man down on the road, I'm pacey
Two lighties on the phone, so facety
One named Jordan and one named Stacey
S with the S from the S, ask Showkey
Dust man down with a mask like Tobi
Tell a boy cotch, my man's telling me lots
But we are not Gs so don't watch my face
[Verse 4: AJ Tracey]
Ladbroke Grove is where I re- who?
Man get burst up in the G- who?
Came back with a fresh one, it's new
Don't come around for a two of the blue
I don't give a fuck if you're old or new
I'll just yawn like "blackball who?"
Put a couple dead MCs in the grave
Trust me, darg, you can go there too
Trust me, darg, you can go there free
I don't ever watch F-A-C-E
AJT from MTP
NikeLab tracksuit, Nike ID
Man got overly fucked in the beef
Pretty sure I landed a bang to his teeth
Man will get banged in the face by me
Not my bredrin, banged in the face by me

[Verse 5: Dave]
And me
Man talk tough, we'll see
Hit him with the left-right, left-right, left-right-right
One jab, then I duck, then weave
Come like Trevor from GTA
If I bang man's face, man bop, then lean
Kun Aguero, man dropped the shoulder feint once
Quick kick then I drop man's G
First time I link her, Nando's, sweet
£9.95, I swipe, then eat
I one-two rap, she don't give hat
Thiago Silva, man block, then skeet
Had man screaming "look, there's my man"
Hand in my pouch like "where? It's not me"
Hand in my pouch like "where? It's not us"
Turned to my G like "where? It's not we"
So if you get boom with the .45 long
It's a critical hit, no chance to repeat
And if you see Arge in the cut with the dip
You're pissed so quick your team should retreat
But if you see Juss in the cut with his right hand tucked
You're fucked, your team should leave, G
If you see Rapz in the back with his hand in the bag
It's mad, we came to see Ps
[Hook: Dave & AJ Tracey]
Walk in the rave, smile on my face
Drink in my cup, hand in my jeans
Man talk tough, man look up, down, left, right
Straight to a bang in the teeth
Man still talk tough, man saw man in the flesh
Now man's tryna talk to my Gs
Nah, none of that, none, .45 drum
Run you right out of your street
Walk in the dance, chicks wanna glance
Hand on my hip, shank for the dip
If I shout "oi", them man there best skip
Better tie up your laces tight and don't trip
Trip, get splashed
Couldn't care less about my man's gang
We're not fam, we're not friends or bredrins
You'll get tanned and binned, cock, then blam

JAE5

[Chorus: Burna Boy]

And my dawg is on probation
Another 5 years

No time, no

[Verse 1: Dave]
Send me the location
This year ’bout vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can’t see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting
[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location

[Verse 2: Dave]
Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweet as naani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, pardon me, I’m laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man’s parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don’t want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets
[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation

And I can pull a couple grand out my pocket right now

Yeah I'm so fly, yeah I'm flyer than a rocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And all the games you play never stop right now
(Right now, right now, right now)

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
No map, North Cap, bend it up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave big fat spliff pon me, nuh
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make her live my life, oh

And I can pull a couple grand out my pocket right now

[Chorus: Burna Boy]

Song title: Wanna Know (Remix)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, they try to send for me
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies
All that for them, right back at them
What my mind keeps telling me
Mind keeps telling me
I hear everything, I don't ask if it's all there cause it better be
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling
Jizzzle never won no wrestling
But he's on a big bell metal ting
Streets unruly
More life for my brother's tryna better things, cause...

[Hook: Dave]
Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ah, ah, ah, ahhh
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough, these catties they be calling off my phone
All these man dem, they applaud me on the road

[Verse 2: Dave]
I put corn in for my bro
Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, but all my man are bros
And all my man, all my man are bros
My man dem will have your mandem on the ropes
I'll have man dem on your road
Man dem in a batch or on they own
With a bat or with a pole
I got man dem that will slap a man with both
Nike jacket on my back I'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know, but
[Hook: Dave]
All my man are running to the money
We be running like ah, ah, ah, ahhh
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa

Song title: Funky Friday

[Intro]
1-6
Game

[Chorus: Dave]
At this age, how are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on the girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating

[Verse 1: Dave]
I came in, 550 on trainers
Island girl amazing, could be Bajan, Trini or Haitian
She, got a bag with flowers
If the trainers match I'll take it
Me and bro just shut down Gucci
Had the whole of the shop floor waitin'
Who's that girl in the line
With the big behind that's looking all tempting?
If, her friend is a dead ting
Take one for the team with a bredrin
Two, peng tings at the entrance
Want attention but a man can't let them
She, must think I'm a reverend
You ain't comin' here getting redemption, no way
[Chorus: Dave]
At this age, how are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on the girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating

[Verse 2: Fredo]
I see dem man skatin' now, I'm talking about running their legs
My youngens in country plugging the Z
He can't even buck me till nothing is left
I flooded my right, I flooded my left
I'm ducking your wife, I'm ducking the feds
The bell on the trap, it's buzzin' again
But still I ain't trying to get busted by feds
Look, man, I ain't caught the bus in a sec'
It's me and my rambo cuttin' through West
The way that I went and just flooded my neck
I'm shocked that I ain't gotta struggle for breath
With me and the missus be going on dates
She's holding the dipper, I'm holding her waist
Just see some pigs moving low in the mains
So I phone up my nigga and told him the plate
[Verse 3: Dave]
Tell a peng girl you can HMU
I don't wanna cuddle and H-U-G
And I'm still shopping in HMV
For all of my niggas in HMP
Heard you got a girl going DMU
If I DM'd you would she DM me?
Young black brudda I'm a stylish g
Man I put the IC in IC3

[Verse 4: Fredo]
They tell me I'm gifted in rap
Nothing was nice, used to live in the trap
Now if I go ask that chick for her snap
I can bet money she's giving me that
I'm always in Harrods, I'm filling the bag
Them niggas ain't winners, them niggas are mad
Gyal at my vids and them bitches are bad
They get picked in the foreigns and ditched in the cab
Game

[Chorus: Dave]
At this age, how are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on the girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Samantha

[Chorus: Dave]
I changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster

[Verse 1: J Hus]
Quickly stop off at the off-licence
Bossman, let me get a two-two drink
Gyaldem ah' watch my 'ting
How 'bout a crook and a princess combining
And I've been givin' gyal the good pipe
And man walked in, yo, it's not what it looks like
Give man high five, kiss her goodnight
I'm in your eyesight
But I'm not your type, I'm more like your life
Keep quiet, I'm preaching
Put a sock in it, put a sock on the fire alarm
Fingers lookin' like a firearm
Well I spit this fire
Plus I came with the fire
Um, what's that ting with the silencer?
Man come through and silence 'em
I was never the cool kid
More like strange and awkward
Biscuit for your forehead
Till my forearm's exhausted
I been road my fortress
Spent four months in the forefront
We party for a fortnight
But I was too weak by the fourth night
[Chorus: Dave]
I changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster
I changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster

[Verse 2: Dave]
We are not Gs, I am not from your ends
I don't give a fuck what you done
Two young Gs, arms out, nobody move, you can get stuck in the mud
We sent your man to the shop
What do you mean? He ain't ever made it rain
Your man is a fraud, your boyfriend's livin' a lie
You're kinda like Rachel Zane
I'm gentle when it comes to the girl dem
But I'm gangster with some voddy and voss
My girl don't wanna stop for a chat
Then I'm onto her friends like Joey and Ross
Babe, what you mean you can't talk for a sec?
It's calm, you don't even know what you lost
Stone Island from my head to my feet
When I step on the street, I dunno what it cost, but
I know it's expensive
She told me she love me but really I don't even know if she meant it
And if feds pull this whip, that's numerous offences
Why you gassed off a rack?
I put three on my dentist, I put three on my dentist
[Bridge: J Hus]
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing

[Chorus: Dave]
I changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster
I changed my number couple times cah' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster21EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: No Words

[Intro: Dave]
I don't wanna dead no
I don't wanna sort it
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
(Steel Banglez)

[Chorus: Dave]
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out

[Verse 1: MoStack]
I don't wanna talk 'bout the ins and outs
But in my bank, more money goes in than out
So I had to 'llow the paigon, allow the baiting
If I touch you, I'll bet you my house gets raided
I'm with some dumb youts that'll blaze for cussing
Don't raise their yout but they will raise the suttin'
And I like my car with the roof off
I like my girl in Louboutin
But sometimes I'm with the duttiest girls
'Cause those are the easy ones
But too bad they only see me once
'Cause we one night them
I wonder why we don't like them
All this money I spend, 'cause I...
[Chorus: Dave]
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words

[Bridge: Dave]
Cause I'm, self made, self paid
Girls wanna phone for a friend
Over and over again
Over and over and over again
Self made, self paid
Girls wanna phone for a friend
Over and over again
Over and over and over again

[Verse 2: MoStack]
Not again, oh my days
Another girl with her sly ways
And why is this girl moving sideways?
Every time my iPhone ping, she's looking at it sideways
I need a gyal that rubs back and gives massages
Not a gyal that backchats and sends messages
Saying she hates me then loves me
Says "fuck you", then fucks me
[Verse 3: Dave]
Yo, walk in a party, standard
Where's your army? Where's your mandem?
On Insta, sitting in a mad whip
In traffic, man are looking like a catfish
Fake youts, plastic
Stop acting, man are all average
My girl got a body boombastic
Elastic, call her Mrs Fantastic

[Pre-Chorus: MoStack]
Like ooh, pull up in a car, I cruise
Hopped out cool, nice move
Why she wanna know? When I said I'm with a star
She just turned around and she said "who?"
Took her home with us, that's standard
She wanna roll with us, that's standard
Niggas getting paid, that's standard
This Mo and Dave, that's bangers

[Chorus: Dave]
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Streatham

[Intro]
Look

[Chorus]
I grew up in Streatham
Teachers was givin' man tests
Same time the mandem were givin' out testers
I got peng tings givin' man stress
I ain't gotta sex it, message or text it
I don't wanna do you and I
Like I'm in Leicester skippin' my lectures
We used to ride 'round all reckless

[Verse 1]
Stolen 'peds, that's Geely and Vespas
And the feds called my broski restless
Said he got a charge in the car, no Tesla
And everybody 'round me rowdy
I walk in, tell the jeweler, "Wow me"
If you're talkin' 'bout P's just 'low me
19, I put 19 on an Audi
I'll never forget that day that I found me the cutest caramel brownie
And the chest and back both bouncy
Trust me, everyting shake, no Saudi
My G just came out for a shooting
And Ramz done a madness, charting
Say that man got something in common
'Cause trust me, both of their tings been barking
If you see him at a drinkup, park him
Do it like Jordan, run up and spark him
My G's been on badness, way before they had a moustache like Stalin
And this ting's all love and hate, 'cause a lot of man love to hate
My young G done draws and eights
Now he's cuttin' through bricks like the 1-1-8
And I ain't on indirects, diss me, and I take that personal
How you gassed off a note that's purple?
Bet you never got it off white like Virgil
Two men and an angry Merc
That's war wit' a German, Winston Churchill
It's mad when man wanna murk you
But you know you gotta be in by curfew
And I seen a lot of man get pressured, why?
[Chorus]
I grew up in Streatham
And teachers was givin' man tests
Same time mandem were givin' out testers
I got peng tings givin' man stress
I ain't gotta sex it, message or text it
I don't wanna do you and I
Like I'm in Leicester skippin' my lectures
We used to roll 'round all stupid

[Verse 2]
Mitcham Lane, that's Streatham and Tooting
I'm in East tryna link my girl
'Cause I've got a baby, a crossbow like Cupid
Man are dead or in jail, that's useless
Tell a yute, "If you've got a brain, then use it"
Now I drive past man I went school with
You was the cool kid, now you look clueless
And I'm still tryna tell man, "Fuck the Audi, switch it for a Benz"
When you're tryna make it out the ends
Friends of enemies are enemies
And enemies of enemies are friends
Fuck the Benz, I switch it for a Beamer
Tell the dealer, "Need a bigger litre"
He told me he's on me when he sees me
I barely remember why we're beefin'
[Chorus]
But I grew up in Streatham
And teachers was givin' man tests
Same time mandem were givin' out testers
I've got peng tings givin' me stress
Nudes in the message, put in an effort
But I don't need a me and you
Like when a chef would eat at his restaurant22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

But don't watch that 'cause you could get
You could get nauseous, could get seasick
I mean, all of my ex-girls hate me
But how you gonna have my baby, baby?
Don't you know I'm livin' that, baby boy?
Lifestyle everyting crazy
If you don't chat to your guy, your G'll see
I ain't talkin' Mercedes, naw
Let's talk 'bout drama
I got a peng brownin' in my zone
And I'm in the zone too like Karma
Man, pull up, hop out, pull over
If it's palava, call say nada
Now I'm in the party with Tara
And that girl got body like armour
Football and Balenciagas
Or I kick ball in my all-black Pradas
No actin', never went RADA
I'm a top boy like Sully but darker
Hahaha, what's the drama?
Peng ting still get aired
Left on read then blue like Barça
If it ain't about face, don't dial me
If it ain't about face, won't answer
I got a brownin' livin' in Sydenham
Professor X 'cause truth say the back ain't there
But the brain is brilliant
And my new ting came with kids
And that's okay 'cause I am still dickin' it
Little man wanna jump on FIFA
So I'm close to the son like Icarus
Whitewash man then I'm back in the room with his ma
Tryna whitewash that for the thrill of it
No bareback, man gotta jimmy it
Backside jigglin', shakin', ripplin'
And it not just ticklin'
Tryna hide my face cah' can't stop gigglin'
Them man all hickory dickory
Watch glistenin' but the Rollie tickin', it's
It's, it's such a shame

They're not around no more
They're not around no more
And who do you think that's because of?

[Verse 2]
Was it us that got a man movin'?
Don't be stupid
No bumper with a bumbah
New number, hit her back like, "Who's this?"
Cucumber in her belly like a broomstick, huh
R8 or the Lamborghini?
The man there don't plan to see me
Cah' my niggas on Greece like Santorini
I've got a brownskin girl from Bush
That will take that charge in a test' if I say so
Both hands on her wig while I hit from the back
Got me pullin' on her tracks and cane rows
Two man in a Superdry jacket and new Astra
Man, it's lookin' like plain clothes
We ain't never had halos
Just Henny and Jenny from the block, no J-Lo
This year here is gonna be a mad one
I need a good girl, I need a bad one
I need a brand new vest and a handgun
Dem man need that more than a man does
Dem man need cash more than a man does
Dem man been crashed more than a man, look
You don't wanna end up in my bad books
It's not a good look givin' man a bad look

Song title: How I Met My Ex

[Verse 1]
Like
I met my girl when I was 18 years old
And she was just turning 23
I really love her from my heart
And even though I don't deserve it fam I hope she loves me
So I just done this private show I'm doing Footlocker promo
And judging from the postcode it was Shoreditch or Soho
Did 6 or 7 tracks, made 6 or 7 racks
A couple days later on twitter I saw this photo of myself and I was grinning
That 4K camera of quality had got me tripping
So I'm checking out who did it
When I stumbled on this girl
And I could tell that she was different
A couple hours later now I'm liking all her pictures
I ain't finished
I typed her twitter name into my Insta so I could check on every single little digit
Why didn't I just message her?
Trust me I was thinking, but I'm a self-centred rapper too concerned about my image
The truth
So when she hit me first I'm pretty shocked I didn't burst
I'm calling Josh, Jack and Juss who am I ringing first?
Man, I was so excited
That I replied a minute later that's that "Bro I think that you just let her know" excited
Too excited, no clue on what I should do excited
So I'm just typing, rambling like a fool, excited
[Verse 2]
Look
Look
And we were talking for hours over some minor things
Ignoring everyone else to her I'm replying quick
This type of chick she got a spark like you were lighting spliffs
You know you like her when you're thinking about your words
She got me typing, deleting my messages then re-writing
In the hope that there's a smile when she's replying
The highlight of my day, them phone calls in the night, it's the little things
The girl, she had a vibe and I liked it and
She's into photography and she's got a passion for it
And she respects that I'm rapping but she ain't catting for it
See that's the perfect balance
There's nothing better than a girl with talent
Drive, ambition, all of them things above
She's showing in abundance
I ain't even met her yet
She works around the corner but lives just outside of London
I ain't fronting, I'm a sweet boy
Intentions are in question so my compliments are decoys
If that even makes sense?
The first time I met her, I'm surrounded by my friends
Random ends on some staircase
So much for a first date
I just had a show
And I asked if she could meet me after
Maybe we could chill, you never know where things could go
No problem she down to roll
Travelled in the cold
So I went across the road, grey hoodie under a coat
If I'm remembering correctly
It's always kind of weird when the person that you were texting
Is the person you are obsessed with
I was on her from the jump
I think she was wearing pumps or Vans when I first met her, no, it's either either one
She was looking so attractive I barely saw skin 'cause she was covered like a mattress
Man, I think that she's the one
I was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hug
And all my friends are drunk so fuck it, I'm about to kiss her
Any complications, I'm blaming it on the liquor
Changing my name on Twitter and blocking her on my Insta
I saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touched
She pulled my bottom lip until it stretched
Kissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neck
And had me moaning like a bitch
Even though I'm wearing jeans, I had to re-arrange my dick so she don't see that I'm erect
It's the first time we met, got me feeling like a creep
And that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little taste
And we could speak about anything we were friends first
I dropped her to the station I remember
'Cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreams
And the things that we hadn't seen and all that we intended to do
I bet she's hoping my intentions are true
And as months went by we both got into it, and intimate
And I'ma spare you the details 'cause both of our parents are probably listening
But really we were into it
Into us, into this
Into everything about each other we were lovers and I love her 'cause she knows me and that's probably why she told me you ain't ready for a girl
You're still a little kid that's getting ready for the world and you don't need that kinda burden
But I told her that I want it
And I'm just being honest, yes I know that girls exist but I don't see them as a problem
I meant every single word
And I ain't gonna lie and say DM's have been absurd but out of every single girl
This is the weirdest of positions
It's usually the girl that's asking where I see her fitting or a place on her position
But I'm telling her I need it
And I don't think she sees it, so I'm being even sweeter when we're speaking and we're meeting
I've got affectionate messages, you could read them
You gotta tell a girl that she's beautiful 'til she sees it
Believes it, understands it more than physically
Mentally, and the way that I'm feeling
I could talk for 10 years about the moments that we shared
The jokes that we had running
The places that we've been
The music we made together producing next to my bed
Then making my minor changes in reference to what she said
I think I start to getting tired, my schedule's a mess
Replies are gettin' lazy and my lady knows it's crazy
But she's there if I'm in need
While I'm at shows getting tempted by girls that are on their knees
You know I'm only a teen, it's like my eyes started drifting
Not as easy as I pictured to give your all to a woman
Ignoring all this attention that's been getting to my head
The sex is so accessible, one message or text and girls will get in your bed
She's tryna make it happen with photos at her events
I mentioned it's her passion, photography is her thing
And I don't know if it's the pressure
Where paper meets the passion and the pleasure
We've all gotta work to survive
So now she's popping up at shows
Taking pictures on her own
And at first it wasn't cool
But fuck it we let it go
Until I saw her in some rapper's tracksuit, I felt a way
She told me it was work and she was in some studio
Taking pictures and I just sighed
Some halfway wannabe rappers that fed her lies
They ain't looking for no picture
I know it's your profession
But read their intentions
They ain't paying male photographers to shoot that same session
And that felt so disrespectful, standing on her dreams
And crushing 'em, I just told her it's nothing do what you need to do
If I ain't feeding you
Then my opinion's all I'm giving when I speak to you
'Cause I don't have the right
Why should girls be punished for a male's dirty mind?
When I think about it now, I'm ashamed to the core
I mean how many men stop their women from achieving what they can because in secret they've been feeling insecure
And I can't handle my emotions, it's probably why I didn't see her
Talent when I shoulda been supporting and promoting
Like I didn't have a platform, a voice and a following
With everyone I knew, I really coulda done a lot of things to help chase her dream
But instead of me to grow into the person that she needs
I acted like I couldn't see
And I don't mean to say this like I don't trust the girl
But how can I trust her if I don't trust myself?
And even girls can get tempted you know how it goes
What if she meets a bigger rapper when she's at a show?
What if he sees her backstage?
What if he selling lots?
What if he's got a bigger car, got a better watch?
That doesn't bother me, she really ain't material
It's all the little things they do that put the fear in you
What if he actually replies?
What if he phones her too?
What if he's doing all the things that I'm supposed to do?
What if he's listening, laughing, relating?
What if he even cares to ask her how her day's been?
What if he's trying to give her everything she needs and expects from the one damn person that she's dating?
I shoulda helped her follow her dream
But instead I held her back and had her following me
And boys got a brave face so they'll never know
That it hurts just as much when you let them go20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Psycho

[Intro]
Tuesday, 23rd of January, 2018
I'm here with David
This is our first session
We're just gonna talk about your background
Where you're from, any issues you've been dealing with
So, where should we start?

[Verse]
Look
Stop all the pain
How do you stop all the pain, huh?
I used to hear a voice when I was praying
But nowadays, I don't even wanna be saved
Nah, fuck that, I don't wanna be saved
I was born to be wild, I don't wanna be tamed
Talent's in my blood and I don't wanna be vain
But if I'm a psycho, then I don't wanna be sane
I used to dream of this shit when I was hopping on train
So, so bad, I used to want all the fame
My ex-girl want to shoot a cover for Vogue
Which is pretty ironic 'cause she's top of the range
If any one of you take a shot on a track
My niggas come back and put a shot in your frame
Easy as the alphabet
Three G's in the ring, call me Alvarez
My teacher used to say I need counseling
Couldn't stop asking me, "What do you feel?"
There's so many old scars that they wanna reveal
We got off on the wrong foot 'cause I don't want him to heal, nah
But if you're looking for a psycho, you got one
I thought I had a screw loose but I lost one
Ninety-nine problems, money, it is not one
My currency's Kenyan, that's in it for the long run, huh
Tears on a pillow
Bro, I shed so many tears on a pillow
I used to tell my teachers that nobody gets it
I don't know Clarke but I know that I'm a Kidult
'Cause my mummy ain't been home, miss thinks I'm involved
Blame my environment, it made me a sicko
Furthermore, I should bring that bitch down to Streatham
And then make her spend a day in a veil like a widow
Kiddo, we seen swords longer than a limo
My bros are blacksmiths like Jaden and Willow
Man, there's weapons over here, we're reppin' over here
We're from the Southside but it's Streatham over here
No telling if you're selling, hold the wettin' over here
Get him over here, who the fuck is checkin' over here?
Most my niggas are the ones applying pressure over here
Fuck assault, I can get a nigga peppered over here, whoa
We wanted more, then some food on the strip or moving a brick
My niggas went to school with the rich and we were broke
Hiding crow in a Rubicon drink
Which is funny 'cause that's how we put food in the fridge
So, who am I?
Someone tryna live his best life
I just wanna take a pretty woman for a test drive
If I bring her to my room and I press, I
Guarantee she gonna see the force like an ex-wife
People tell me I'm a little bit barmy
For my army, I need a bottle of Bacardi
If it's me and a pouch with my dargy
Shawty, you're seeing two stars in the party
Fuck what you heard
I'm a top boy and I ain't giving man a turn
I don't wanna know a pretty woman wanna flirt
Learned you can judge a nigga by the women that he curves
I love this game, I ain't lost focus
I'm a hitmaker, if you haven't noticed
I could be the rapper with the message like you're hoping
But what's the point in me being the best if no one knows it?
Brother I'm a careful, humble, reckless, arrogant, extravagant
Nigga probably battlin' with manic depression
Man, I think I'm going mad again
It's like I'm happy for a second then I'm sad again
And to my fans, the reason I could get to this
You're my drug, the instrumental my therapist
Man, I need some therapy
My girl saying that she'll never leave
I'm scared she gonna find a better me
Deeper insecurities, like
What if I don't leave a legacy?
Money, why they check for me?
Mummy lost respect for me
I wish we could be together but that ain't how life works
I used to cry about my dad until my fucking eyes burnt
Nose running, you don't know nothing
Before I put a penny on the table, I provided for my family
Held my mother's hand through the agony, hey
You ever fall 'sleep 'cause you don't wanna be awake?
In a way, you're tired of the reality you face?
If you're thinking 'bout doing it
Suicide doesn't stop the pain, you're only moving it
Lives that you're ruining
Thoughts of a world without you in it, hiding
I ain't psycho but my life is18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
