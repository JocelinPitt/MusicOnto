Song title: The Business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Verse 1]
Mama, please don't worry 'bout me
'Cause I'm about to let my heart speak
My friends keep telling me to leave this
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you onе more night, one more night to gеt this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, back and forth with the bullshit
I know I said it before, I don't mean it
It's been a while since I had your attention
So it might hurt to hear this
[Bridge]
(Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Dreams we have don't ever fall away
We can't live 'em if we stay the same
And I can't do this for another day
So let's get down, let's get down to business

[Chorus]
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business
Let's get down, let's get down to business
Give you one more night, one more night to get this
We've had a million, million nights just like this
So let's get down, let's get down to business, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, yeah4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Wasted

[Intro]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
You are a catch-22, either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah


[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted

Oh woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Red Lights

[Verse 1]
Blacked out
Everything faded on your love
I’m already wasted so close
That I can taste it now, now
So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

[Chorus]
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

[Verse 2]
White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore
We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us
We’re going to make it now
What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...
[Chorus]
Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: On My Way

[Chorus]
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on way, way

[Verse 1]
There's a little devil in us all
Swear everybody in this town just wants to see you fall
Baby, it's no fun, so know it's just a game, yeah
Oh, keep running outta love
And I don't go giving up
When I'm running outta love, love
No, let's say I've had enough
And I don't go giving up
I said it all before

[Chorus]
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say

Song title: Just Be

I was lost
And I'm still lost but
I feel so much better
You can travel the world
But you can't run away
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be
Make us believe in you
Keep all your light in the dark
If you're searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And make sense of what you can see
Just be
Just be

They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step
That you take when you want to be real
Flying on planes to exotic locations
Won't teach you
How you really feel
Face up to the fact
That you are who you are
And nothing can change that belief
Just be
Just be
Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
The hardest part
Is inside me
I need
To just be
Just be

I was lost
And I'm still lost
But I feel so much better

Cause now I know
It's not so far
To where I go
There's not this spot
Since this I feel
I need
To just be
Just beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1: John Legend]

You ain't like the rest

Gettin' undressed

Oooooooooh
I wanna be wherever you are, baby

Song title: Written In Reverse

[Verse 1]
I wish I was more than a cloud in your universe
I wish there was room in the sky for the two of us
'Cause when I hear you loud, it’s a hell of a sound
Oh, when I hear you loud, it’s a hell of a sound
If you were here right now, I’d be telling you how
We'll turn it all around

[Chorus]
If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning
Our love would be rehearsed
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it?
Would you love me till it hurts?
And then maybe we could make it
You and I
(If we were written in reverse, ah)
Maybe we could make it
You and I

[Verse 2]
I wish we were still in New York on the avenue
Living in before we had known any other view
'Cause when I hear you loud, it’s a hell of a sound
Oh, when I hear you loud, it’s a hell of a sound
If you were here right now, I’d be telling you how
We'll turn it all around
[Chorus]
If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning
Our love would be rehearsed
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it?
Would you love me till it hurts?
And then maybe we could make it
You and I
(If we were written in reverse, ah)
Maybe we could make it
You and I

[Verse 3]
If we were written in reverse
And the end was our beginning (Was our beginning)
Our love would be rehearsed (Love would be rehearsed)
And the pain would turn to healing
If we were written in reverse
Would you find a way to say it?
Would you love me till it hurts?
And then maybe we could make it
You and I2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
