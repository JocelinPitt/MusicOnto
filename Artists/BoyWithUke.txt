Song title: Two Moons

[Verse 1]
Two moons, I can feel myself start catching on fire
But you knew, yeah, you kept it to yourself, to yourself
Two moons, I get lost on my way searching for liars
This ain't good for my health, no, this ain't good for my health

[Chorus]
Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I don't feel serene (No)
No, I don't feel too clean (Oh)
And I don't want to be the one to make you cry
I'll play inside, I'll start a fire
I'll tell your friends that I lost my mind
And it'll take a while, but I'll start to smile
Broken windows and broken tiles
Frozen willows will go for miles
Hope will let go, yeah, that's it's style
And you don't know where my soul's heading
I'm forgetting you, so I say
[Chorus]
Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Left, right, my eyesight is diminishing
My life sucks, at night I tried to finish it early
Pearly whites get blurry
Surely I'll go bite the dirty dust
Cuts deeper as my head goes nuts
I'll be a believer if I ever see trust
I must be disgusting rust
God, I hate myself, I just wanna unplug
Yeah, fuck no, I go where I want to
But I'm stuck in my bedroom
I'm telling lies to keep myself from hurting those around you
Yeah, after all these years, I found you (I found you)
(Again)
[Chorus]
Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

[Outro]
(I close my door, I'm left with less)
(I close my door, I'm left with less)6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Toxic

[Verse 1]
All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless
So rude and always negative
I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy
Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe

[Chorus]
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh

[Bridge]
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)

[Verse 2]
But life is immaculate, backin' it up a bit
Countin' my hours and knocking on wood
Avoiding my opposites, chewin' on chocolate
Had a bit limited time, but I should
Be good for a minute, don't want to admit it
I'm running on seconds, I'm rigid, I'm screwed
Don't know what to do, I'm thinking of you
I'm drinking up bottles and bottles of booze
[Chorus]
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh

[Verse 3]
I fell into your river
That's where you told me lies
You said that I'd feel better
But this is where good guys die
You took my pride away
But you cannot take my light
I'll find another way out
But now you're takin' my life
Don't you see how I—

[Chorus]
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh
I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, ohEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Shy

[Chorus]
Hi, hello
I'm quite a shy fellow
Yo no recuerdo palabras cuando estoy contigo
And I still don’t know how to let go
Of feelings that I felt for you, baby
And my anxiety's pushing limits
Setting benchmarks higher than the fucking moon
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude
And I’ve been fighting feelings
'Cause I know that I'm too shy to make a move
Looking up tutorials on YouTube

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Stay inside
I'll be home by the morning
Run down high
Stay asleep in your bed because it's pouring
My mind I find to be my decline, I'm fine
Don't ask me how I spend my free time, yeah
Don't ask me why, don’t ask me

[Chorus]
Hi, hello
I’m quite a shy fellow
Yo no recuerdo palabras cuando estoy contigo
And I still don't know how to let go
Of feelings that I felt for you, baby
And my anxiety’s pushing limits
Setting benchmarks higher than the fucking moon
Sorry, I don't mean to be rude
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I cry
Kinda like a bit of every other line
My insides are reclined 'cause sometimes I feel I rewind
Way too far
I played with cars, when I was younger
Now I'm driving down the street to see my friends turn to cigars

[Chorus]
And I’ve been fighting feelings
'Cause I know that I'm too shy to make a move

Song title: LoveSick

[Verse 1]
Hey, I heard you're doing better, never knew you as a quitter
And I'm glad you're doing okay
I don't know if you remember all the times you wrote me letters
And I think you took me out in fifth grade
And I think I told you no, I said I wanna take it slow
And I also called you gross to your face
But I think everybody knows it was just a funny joke
So do you wanna go on that date?

[Chorus]
I've been feeling quite amazing flying kites with you
Rephrasing words from songs that I wrote myself
It ain't good for my health
But I spend nights thinkin' of you
I write you songs when I miss you
I promise I'll be there to help
Though I might need a ride

[Post-Chorus]
You keep catchin' my eyes
Even when I'm terrified
Can't get you off of my mind

[Verse 2]
Oh, I've been feeling faded 'cause I'm fiending on the Hennessy
Tell everyone I made it, though I'm miles from where I want to be
I told my story countless times to all these fucking companies
I used to be a worthless piece of shit, a boy with issues, see
I've changed throughout this year so much that who I was you won't believe
Obsessed with being normal, faking cordial actions, fantasies
Of situations playing out so perfect like the movie scenes
I want to take my mask off, but I'm scared because I'll never be enough for me
I think I'm losing grip on sanity
[Chorus]
I've been feeling quite amazing flying kites with you
Rephrasing words from songs that I wrote myself
It ain't good for my health
But I spend nights thinkin' of you
I write you songs when I miss you
I promise I'll be there to help
Though I might need a ride

[Post-Chorus]
You keep catchin' my eyes
Even when I'm terrified
Can't get you off of my mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Blurry Nights

[Verse 1]
You said that you love me
But you told a lie
Outside you're lovely
But I've seen inside
And all of your friends told me
Time wasn't right

[Pre-Chorus]
You go too slow
You stay so cold
I speak my mind
You still say no

[Chorus]
It's blurry nights
That haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out
Might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go
I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But I'll get over you
Oooh... x2

[Verse 2]
Two things on my birthday
I don't want a cake give me a Sunday
Where I don't think of getting hanged
I don't wanna play just give one day

[Verse 3]
Where I don't think of getting played
I'm a sensitive guy with no touché
I done fucked up, on my plate
I got plenty of problems, It's too late

[Chorus]
It's blurry nights
That haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out
Might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go
I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But I'll get over you
Oooh... x2

[Pre-Chorus]
You go too slow
You stay so cold
I speak my mind
You still say no

[Chorus]
It's blurry nights
That haunt my mind
Don't wanna find out
Might just cry
I might have tied myself up high
And just let go
I'll touch the sky for you
It's blurry nights I can't get through
You told me lies I thought were true
But I'll get over youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Loafers

[Verse 1]
I keep my windows open, front doors broken, I lost my keys
I'm passed out on my futon, gave back your DVD's
It's been so long, but you're embedded to my thoughts
And all the songbirds sing sad songs
So how I treated you so wrong?
I stay up all night long

[Chorus]
I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we weren't meant to be
I'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live on the same street

[Post-Chorus]
You're in my melatonin dreams
My eyes can't read what's in between
'Cause it's been all just make-believe
And all I see are fantasies
'Cause I'm sippin' on kava tea
(Sippin' on kava tea)
('Cause it's been all just make-believe)
[Verse 2]
Let's just say goodbye to the good times
Once and for all, just let 'em go
I know they still give you butterflies
I'm stuck in an awful state of mind
Let it be known that I'm alone
So lost from a romantic paradise

[Chorus]
I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we weren't meant to be
I'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live on the same street

[Post-Chorus]
You're in my melatonin dreams
My eyes can't read what's in between
'Cause it's been all just make-believe
And all I see are fantasies
'Cause I'm sippin' on kava tea

[Refrain]
Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis remplie de tristesse et je suis troublé
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I'll feel your pain temporarily
Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis remplie de tristesse et je suis troublé
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I'll feel your pain temporarily
[Bridge]
And I thought we could be more than just friends
But I can understand your situation
I felt like you should know, though since we're such good friends
I guess I'll just wait until you feel okay enough to see me like I see you
But until then, I can just be your guy best friend

[Chorus]
I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we weren't meant to be
I'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live on the same street

[Refrain]
Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse et je suis trompé (You're in my melatonin dreams)
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I'll feel your pain temporarily (My eyes can't read what's in between)
Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse et je suis trompé ('Cause it's been all just make-believe)
Weren't meant to be (And all I see are fantasies)
But it's okay, I'll feel your pain temporarily4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Out of Tune

[Chorus]
No matter what I do
I can't love because of you
You fucked me up and put me out of tune
I do my best to fake that I'm good
But I forget my place too soon
Oh, can't you say goodbye
To the scars you left behind?
How 'bout you get the fuck outta my mind?
I swear that I can't feel love
Oh, won't you say goodbye
To all my butterflies?
I can't look you in your eyes again

[Verse 1]
I began to track dark times with no peach
Lime smoothies, no time for bus rides with
Sad rhymes to climb right out of dark times
I pass the clock by watching you playing Fortnite
No, for real, that's what got me through this whole ordeal
Stuck out of tune, I made it through by watching Key and Peele
Stuck in my bed while my heart is turned to steel
Got no covers or no blankets 'cause I know that love ain't real

[Chorus]
No matter what I do
I can't love because of you
You fucked me up and put me out of tune
I do my best to fake that I'm good
But I forget my place too soon
Oh, can't you say goodbye
To the scars you left behind?
How 'bout you get the fuck outta my mind?
I swear that I can't feel love
Oh, won't you say goodbye
To all my butterflies?
I can't look you in your eyes again
[Verse 2]
One day I thought back
When I lacked a lot of stuff that I have
I cracked the moments that I kept to my back
Go back to snowmen that I built in winter times in Minecraft
The beat goes up down, I'm thinkin' about the times that I had
And I was hurt pretty bad, now that I think to myself
It makes the happy inside and the fifty thousand bookshelves
But looking back I'm not mad at all of the shit that I sat through
Yeah, that's true, I bet you I was willing to roam the backrooms for you

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
No matter what I do
I can't love because of you
You fucked me up and put me out of tune
I do my best to fake that I'm good
But I forget my place too soon
Oh, can't you say goodbye
To the scars you left behind?
How 'bout you get the fuck outta my mind?
I swear that I can't feel love
Oh, won't you say goodbye
To all my butterflies?
I can't look you in your eyes again2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Haha, Hi

[Verse 1]
I think we talked about a TV show that you liked
Something I forget 'cause I was thinking, "Whoa, are her eyes real?"
Ain't no way she gon' be feeling what I feel
But I guess I'm not a psycho, 'cause she's sitting in my automobile right now
Singing as I stir my wheel, oh dear
Like how? It's been well over a year
I don't believe it when she says she misses me or when she kisses me
There must be an alternative motive I miss
So help me, please, to understand
How and why you stuck around
It's like you hopped the fence and said nobody is allowed back here
I disregarded all of my fears
And I remember when we first spoke words, I'll say, "I'm here"

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I've got sights from your pretty eyes
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby
Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I can see your face in the light
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby
[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
My baby
(Ooh, ooh) My baby (Ooh, ooh)
My baby

[Verse 2]
I don't appreciate the foliage that blocks being in love with you
Falling on each other, we catch L's but mostly W's
Worry 'bout the lack of time, another time forget to rhyme
Forget about them ends in lines and focus on our aptitude
The poly rhythmic notes upon a measure, we're the only two
Lines in a stanza that don't rhyme, but we somehow do
Winter comes and takes away the sun, but I'll follow through
Drawing inspiration from Romeo Montague
I lose my brain cells when I'm with you
I fell through the fucking room
When I saw you walking through the hallway zone
Can't breathe in this altitude
I'm left with my screws unloose
And you make me feel so good, my baby

[Chorus]
Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I've got sights from your pretty eyes
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my baby
Haha, hi, you've been on my mind
I feel quite alright
When I can see your face in the light
I can't find out if you like the sound of my voice
It's a little squeaky, I try to make it sound deeper for you, my babyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Falling for You

[Intro]
If you want me to, I'll go
And sit next to you
All my thoughts, but I am alone

[Chorus]
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you

[Verse 1]
I close my eyes but I'm too slow
I can't travel on this winding road
Oh, baby, save me, take me home

[Chorus]
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you

[Verse 2]
I'll hold my breaths which should too strecht
Foot steps, first tune
Never thought that I would ever fall in love with you
Black out on the bad thoughts of you
Falling out of forfeit, Ilose
My bad, 'til I catch a glimpse of your shoes
And knew that you were broken too
So I'll lock you up before I circle too
Never thought that I could ever fall for you
Broken Love, but paper Hearth, i'll juke 'cause then you'll love
But I'm-
[Chorus]
I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Tired Of Wanting You

[Verse 1]
I'm not sad, I'm not tired, but I feel I'm bad
I feel different from others, I wish I had what they have
But I'm just dreaming of randomness scheming
I got empty feelings, I wrestle my demons at night

[Chorus]
I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because that's not my character
Maybe in another universe

[Verse 2]
I just think that it's funny that I cannot bring
Myself from my conscience to rid of my butterfly things
I don't feel right when I'm not with you
I'll keep you insight, but I won't pursue

[Chorus]
I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because If I do I'll never sleep
If you say no to me, but you'll probably
I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because that's not my character
Maybe in another universeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
