Song title: Crush on You (Remix)

[Intro: Lil' Cease & Lil' Kim]
Undeas!
Lil Ceaser!
Queen B!
That's Me!
Lil' Kim!
[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Yo, I be buyin' 'em V's, so all my girls be eyein' Cease
Comin' backstage, dyin' to get pleased
You got me, I rock thee, Versace and linen
While you stop your grinnin' wit' bunch of foxy women
Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid
I get clothes, custom made, from a stylist
Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot
It be all good, toss your clothes like a salad
When it's all over, put your vote in my ballot
It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace
It be all good as long as you don't act childish
While you standin' there with the Crist' in your cup
If worse come to worse keep this on the hush, uhh

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Ayo shorty, won't you go get a bag of the lethal
I'll be undressed in the bra all see through
Why you count your jewels thinkin' I'ma cheat you?
The only one thing I wanna do is freak you
Keep your stone sets, I got my own baguettes
And I'll be doin' things that you won't regret
Lil Kim, the Queen Bee, so you best take heed
Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade
Who me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?
I even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile
Whisper in your ear and get you all shook up
But don't blush, just keep this on the hush

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
[Verse 3: Lil' Cease]
While you tryin' to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's
All chrome D3's, decked out TV's
CD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced
Don't be fooled by the baby face
I hope ya not, 'cause your thighs got me hot
Only one plan, that's to rise to the top
I told you before, when I first pursued
I want a interlude, in the nude

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
You know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a
Works from the dealers, full-length chinchilla
Heat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe
Then we speed down the hutch, breakin' trees in the dutch
I'm not the one you sleep wit', to eat quick
Want a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik
You got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course
So I look sick in my six with my Christian LaCroix

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you
I know you seen me on the video (true)
I know you heard me on the radio (true)
But you still don't pay me no attention
Listenin' to what your girlfriends mention
He's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week
It's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you
I had to let you know that I got a crush on you20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Queen Bitch

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A., you wanna be 'em
Most of y'all niggas can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch (on and on, on and on)
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch! Uhh
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch
Shit I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Black Friday

[Intro: Angie Martinez, Nicki Minaj, and Lil' Kim]
It’s funny ‘cause, you know, we’ve been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean, clearly, you’ve been having this thing with Kim
And I don’t know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you’re a rapper –
And I’m thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming -
Even though you say it’s not specifically about her - that Roman’s Revenge is for Kim
Umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know –
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck want war?
Fed Ex beef straight to your front door
It will be a murder scene
I'm turnin' Pink Friday into Friday the 13th
A'ight you Lil' Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery, this shit stops now
Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last name is what got you your job
You a put together gimmick, something like a collage
Since you puttin on a show, you gon get the applause
Clap, clap, lift ya frame like a fucking garage?
This hood shit you and Drake ain't built for
This the shit this other bitch almost got killed for
I still counting what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keeps spinning like its syndicated
Corny broad I'll leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch, should have been deflated
This ain't a championship fight I been the greatest
See the fact is what you doing... I did it
Lames trying to clone my style and run with it
Thats cool. I was the first one with it
Yous a Lil' Kim wanna be, You just hate to admit it
I'm the blueprint, You ain't nothing brand new
Check ya posters and videos, You will always be number 2
I seen them come. I seen them go. Still I remain
Sweety you on your 14th minute of fame
Im over 10 year strong still running the game
Cut the comparison, I'm in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot... Child please I'm solidified
With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried
Either you high or sippin that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado- Brainstorm
I drop bombs- Flex, Napalms
Black and yellow, we'll pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppes when I step out, posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink like my kitty sayin hello
If I whistle they'll pistol whip you in all 5 boroughs
I'm from Brooklyn I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me?
You the type to run your mouth and then run from me
I'm poppin off in your hood with no company
C'mon, Queens ain't showin you no love
I was there the other night poppin bottles with the thugs
You like Washington heffa I'm Benji
You got a buzz right now, I had a frenzy
Oh yeah welcome to the fam Fendi
You need to stop, you're not hot you're a burning match
That means the end is near soon, copy that?
Oh I see they really got you gassed, like I'm a thing of the past
Betta slow down dummy, you about to crash
Stank pussy ho, I'm givin you a bath
Thermometer in hand and I'm comin for ya ass
Who you think you gettin past?
I see right through you, your whole shit is made of glass
[Clip of Nicki Minaj's 'Right Through Me']

[Verse 2]
I draw back
I'm a Brooklyn thorough bitch, rep for my borough bitch
Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit
I ride out til the wheels fall off
And my niggas squeeze til the last shell go off
Fuck your whole team all I see is a bunch of wierdos
You'sa airhead bitch- scarecrow
Ain't nothin old but my money bitch
This is grown liquid assets
Benjamin's my daddy you Young Money bastards
You and Diddy- sorry bunch of swagger jackers
I mothered you hoes I should claim you on my income taxes
Bobby Fischer in the flesh, taught by the great
So on my next move I'm yellin' checkmate
I smell a massacre
I'm Charles Manson, you don't stand a chance with her
Jeffrey Dahmer and you lookin like lunch to me
Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy
Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
You're hilarious... thanks for all the laughs
You're garbage, so I'm takin out the trash
You? Shit on me?
C'mon baby girl- Ain't enough ass shots in the world
You're a nuisance, you'd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me
So chuck it up deuces
All around the world I ball like a ball team
I stack chips, call me Miss Rothstein
Tricks is for kids silly rabbit you're my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring
[Outro: Lil Kim mocking Nicki Minaj]
"I mean I know... I know you guys asked me if Roman’s Revenge was about Kim...
And no, I, it’s not about Kim...
Actually if Kim thought it was about her, I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry, I apologize, Kim
I don’t know, I just had temporary insanity... I lost my teeth and my mind..."25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Dice sounds]
Uh, yeah

Never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on, then it's on

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Bang this in your whips
Pack em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a French kiss
I dismissed all you chicks
Split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ow
I stay focused, in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lyin'
Niggas trying to knock me off, keep tryin'
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay
Set It Off with the eight-fitay
Y'all missin' the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the trunk and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do the Bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap Mae West, the Q-B
And I got all my sisters with me
[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

Getcha back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin' me ladies from club hoppin' gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin' with the glass in my left one
Right-hand sayin' step-son
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
To my niggas straight snitches and to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin' that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer
Lay another finger on this big bad wolf miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin'
To the top and it don't stop
[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right

[Verse 4: Da Brat]
Y'all see, how these bogus niggas
Try not to notice the dopest bitches

But focusin' on they riches
If it's, too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggas dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin' of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle 'em like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger clip
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin' up dust
And you can spread rumors
Shit is makin' me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin' me sayin' you lovin' me
Bet ya phony niggas be buggin', I can tell
Cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the Windy City woman still still comin' and gunnin'
Straight from the Chi?
Tonight's the night for all the ladies, let's get high

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
[Interlude: Missy Elliott]

Patti LaBelle or somebody, nigga? Heh heh
Check it out, uh huh, yeah

[Verse 5: Missy Elliott]
Oh what a night
You should be like Missy 'stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride ponies instead of ridin' bikes
Me and Lil' Kim got the rhymes to incite
I gotta catch a flight, uh heh heh, around three and shit

Ow, niggas wanna be us

That's how many times I wanna cum, twenty-one
And another one, and another one
And another one, 24-karats, nigga
That's when I'm fuckin' with the average nigga
Work the shaft, brothers be battin' me
And oh, don'tcha like the way I roll
And play with my bushy
Tell me, what's on your mind when your tongue's in the pussy?
Is it marriage? (Damn, this bitch is bad)
Baby carriage? (Damn, I love that ass)
Shit no, on a dime shit is mine
Got to keep 'em comin' all the time (Why?)
[Chorus: Lil' Cease and Lil' Kim]
Killas be quiet, my niggas bring the riots

You wanna be this Queen B, but ya can't be

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How B.I.G. and 'Un' trust you in the studio with me
Don't they know I'm tryin' to sex you continuously
Pull a high power Coupe, make you jump ship
Leave who you wit', run with the Roc-A-Fella crew
Trick ya for the cheese, tear your boom up
Spread a ill Rumor, make you flip on Lil' Cease
Twist you backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
Rock Lil' Kim hats and shit
I gets down and dirty for the dough
I got love and B.I.G. know it
He must got the studio bugged
Probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
With the M.A.F.I.A. thugs and all types of heat
But I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm just tryin' to eat
Horizontally, the way I hold my iron, sweet
And, no, my niggas, but I like the sound
Lil' Kim and Jigga, it sound like figures
[Chorus: Lil' Cease and Lil' Kim]
Killas be quiet, my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired

Killas be quiet, my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk, tough walk, shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B, but ya can't be
That's why you're mad at me
[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Before I caught some nigga's disease, got caught with his keys
B.I.G. scooped a young bitch off her knees
Threw me at high priced Beam's
Face on TV's, platinum CD's
Shit, I never faught
It's on nigga, what, pussy greased up
Stack the g's up, keeps the knees up
What the fuck, stay fillin', half a mill'n
Geneva Diva, yeah, I throws it down
Lay around, clown the clock stops for no one
Never 68 and owe 1, takes one to know one
Better off wit the Playboy magazines uh, fuckin' with the Don
Push the keys, G's threes for pape's
Yeah, I ride crate state to state
Lieutenant takes mad dimes from New York to Anaheim
While you daydream and whine, I just keep gettin' mine
And I'm married to this
Y'all strategy misses still plannin' weddings
M.A.F.I.A. also deadens all the bullshit
Any type of threatens to pull shit, uh
[Chorus: Lil' Cease and Lil' Kim]

Song title: #MINE

[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking at it
I don't mind people looking at it
Don't get mad if she ain't looking back at you nigga
Don't get mad if she ain't looking back at you nigga

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grinder

[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
You know how we be moving
Me and Kevin Gates
I'm a star and I'ma keep shining
Like the roof on the Wraith
Eat my pussy with his breakfast
'Cause he love the way it tastes
He said that I stay on his mind
How I be sitting on his face
I don't need nothing but bread
I don't need niggas for nothing but head
They all fantasize being with Kim
Every night, I'm laying right next to him
Fuck my ex, you make me wetter
Fabulous, you make me better
Chanel sneakers, Chanel leather
Chanel bag in Chanel weather
Hundred grand on that PRG
I don't hear what no peon say
See me with him, just know that's me
Ten carats scream fiance
See my pussy print all through my jeans
I know you watch all this ass behind me
Should be watchin' this nigga that's right beside me
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grinder

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
You know how we be moving, listening to Future, Pluto
People like us take over, I'm a shooter with a shooter
Says she down here from up north, college, she commuting
She my new professor, I'm learning, I'm a student
Her momma hate me, say I'm too advanced, ask her how she's doing
She never say it to my face, I'm turnt up I'm a movie, yeah
At night she hear her daughter scream, Cassius Clay, I boom bye yae
My hand around her throat she naked, I bent her over on the dresser
It's too gangsta how I'm dressin', beat the pussy up, no question
Pull her hair ho, you for Kevin, hair red or blonde, or whatever
I-I'm caressin' on her breastes, kissing on her, you a blessin'
Knew I loved her when I met her, she love me, you looking for her

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grind her
[Verse 3: Lil Kim &  Kevin Gates]
You pulled it out and now he's shookin' on it
Grabbed my neck and now I'm choking on it
Hold it down if you go to prison
Conversate, conjugal visits
Keep our love, I got the COD
I'mma hold it down like P.O.P
That dope pussy that chronic
That DRE, so don't OD
Hold up baby, come here, give it to me
I'm about to uh huh, lick the pussy
In the car, don't give a fuck who lookin'And stroking on it, hustle through this for you
Dick her full, don't know if you notice
Say it ain't come here on a muscle
Lot of spit when you humming on it
Legs shaking now you cumming on it
Quiet babe, power coming on it
Uber coming, now you going home
I know it's difficult dealing
With a nigga that's in my profession
Hold up babe, why you in your feelings?
Break it for me, gotta tell your nigga
"Fly a kite" Michael Jackson, thriller
You say, "Don't nobody keep it realer"
Real one, I homicide the vision
Say her name, they gon' get the business
Chris Brown, playing when I killed her
He could fuck you too cause that's my nigga
Hand cuffin' pussy, I ain't with it
She could be for you and treat her special
Yeah, she say she love me, you looking for her
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her

Song title: Not Tonight

[Verse 1]
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, "I'll be back," go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', "Gimme"
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, "rockin' the mic"
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now
[Verse 2]
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
"I thought your ass was still sleepin'"
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
"I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone," screamin'

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
[Verse 3]
The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: How Many Licks?

[Intro: Sisqo]
Hold up, so what you're saying is
(Niggas got me pissed like Lil' Kim)
You want to get freaky again, aight
A-ooh-ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a "Queen Bee Rules" tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark 'til the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

[Chorus: Sisqo]
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
This verse goes out to my niggas in jail
Beatin' they dicks to the double-X-L magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!
Jailer, open up cell, block eight
Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggas do anything for a Lil' Kim poster
Eses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

[Chorus: Sisqo]
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
If you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

[Chorus: Sisqo]
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me, let me know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Yeah)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Baby, tell me)
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Magic Stick

[Chorus 1: 50 Cent]
I've got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic
I got the magic stick

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke
[Chorus 2: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic, uh-huh uh-huh
I got the magic clit

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim not a whore
But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to sex don't test my skills
'Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
And I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the "Drugs", baby, I'm makin ya high!
[Chorus 3: 50 Cent & (Lil' Kim)]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I am the baddest chick)
(Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight)
(And I'll show you magic - what? What?)
Magic (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I got the magic clit)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim & (50 Cent)]
Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tasting it
(Sex ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (One minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
Have that ass trickin' after one back shot
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the CL drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic
I got the magic stick
[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) magic, uh-huh uh-huh

Song title: Suck My Dick

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich

[Verse 1]
To all my motherfuckin' gettin' money hoes
Boosters, sellin' clothes
And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Comin' through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got 'em in the zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?
Imagine if I was dude and hittin' cats from the back
With no strings attached, yeah nigga, picture that
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt
Ay yo, yo, yo, come here so I can bust in ya mouth

[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick
[Verse 2]
No, no, no, no
All I wanna do is get my pussy sucked (Nigga!)
Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y
The BX, the chron-chron and the list goes on and on
(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remy down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin': "Yeah baby, I love you long time"
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick
[Verse 3]
I'ma keep it real, for the dough I might kill
I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said "Whoa! Who's the other guy?
Hope you know you payin' extra for this fuckin' third eye"
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth: "Fool, Give me my money!"
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none

[Chorus: Lil' Kim & Bristal]
Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
