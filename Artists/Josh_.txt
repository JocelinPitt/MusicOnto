Song title: Getting Married Today

[JENNY]
Bless this day
Pinnacle of life
Husband joined to wife
The heart leaps up to behold
This golden day

[PAUL]
Today is for Amy
Amy, I give you the rest of my life
To cherish and to keep you
To honor you forever
Today is for Amy
My, happily, soon-to-be wife

[AMY]
Pardon me, is everybody here?
Because if everybody's here
I'd like to thank you all
For coming to the wedding
I'd appreciate you going even more
I mean, you must have lots of better things to do
And not a word of it to Paul
Remember Paul? You know, the man I'm going to marry
But I'm not, because I wouldn't ruin anyone
As wonderful as he is
Thank you all for the gifts and the flowers
Thank you all, now it's back to the showers
Don't tell Paul, but I'm not getting married today
[JENNY]
Bless this day
Tragedy of life
Husband yoked to wife
The heart sinks down
And feels dead
This dreadful day

[AMY]
Listen everybody, look, I don't know what you're waiting for
A wedding. What's a wedding? It's a prehistoric ritual
Where everybody promises fidelity forever
Which is maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard of
Which is followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he'll realize
He's saddled with a nut, and want to kill me, which he should
Thanks a bunch, but I'm not getting married
Go have lunch, cause I'm not getting married
You've been grand, but I'm not getting married
Don't just stand there, I'm not getting married
And don't tell Paul, but I'm not getting married today

Go! Can't you go?
Why is nobody listening?
Goodbye! Go and cry
At another person's wake
If you're quick, for a kick
You could pick up a christening
But please, on my knees
There's a human life at stake!
Listen everybody, I'm afraid you didn't hear
Or do you want to see a crazy lady fall apart in front of you?
It isn't only Paul who would be ruining his life
You know, we'll both of us be losing our identities
I telephoned my analyst about it, and he said to see him Monday
But by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with the other garbage
I'm not well, so I'm not getting married
You've been swell, but I'm not getting married
Clear the hall, 'cause I'm not getting married
Thank you all, but I'm not getting married
And don't tell Paul, but I'm not getting married today

[JENNY]
Bless this bride
Totally insane
Slipping down the drain
And bless this day in our hearts
As it starts
To rain[PAUL]
Today is for
Amy
Amy, I give you
The rest of my life
To cherish and to keep you
To honor you forever
Today is for Amy
My, happily, soon-to-be wife...
 

My adorable wife... 
[AMY]
Go! Can't you go?
Look, you know I adore you all
But why watch me die
Like Eliza on the ice?
Look, perhaps I'll collapse
In the apse right before you all
So take back the cake
Burn the shoes, and boil the rice
Look, I didn't want to have to tell you
But I may be coming down with hepatitis
And I think I'm gonna faint
So if you want to watch me faint, I'll do it happily
But wouldn't it be funnier to go and watch a funeral?
So thank you for the twenty-seven dinner plates
Thirty-seven butter knives
Forty-seven paperweights
Fifty-seven candle holders[PAUL]
One more thing
 

Softly said
 

With this ring
 

I thee wed
 

Let us pray that we are getting married
 
Today! 
[AMY]
I'm not getting married
 
But I'm not getting married
 
See, I'm not getting married!
 
Still, I'm not getting married!
Let us pray that we're not getting married
Today! 


[CHOIR]
Amen!
 

Amen!
 

Amen!
 

Amen!

What have you been up to, kiddo?[ROBERT, spoken]
Stop!
What do you get?

(sung)

Someone to hold you too close
Someone to hurt you too deep
Someone to sit in your chair
And ruin your sleep

[PAUL, spoken]
That's true, but there's more than that

[SARAH, spoken]
Is that all you think there is to it?

[HARRY, spoken]
You've got so many reasons for not being with someone, but Robert, you haven't got one good reason for being alone

[LARRY, spoken]
C'mon, you're onto something, Bobby. You're onto something

[ROBERT]
Someone to need you too much
Someone to know you too well
Someone to pull you up short
To put you through hell

[DAVID, spoken]
You see what you look for, y'know?

[JOANNE, spoken]
You're not a kid anymore, Robby. I don't think you'll be a kid again, kiddo

[PETER, spoken]
Don't be afraid that it won't be perfect, buddy. The only thing to be afraid of really is that it won't be.

[JENNY, spoken]
Don't stop now. Keep going

[ROBERT]
Someone you have to let in
Someone whose feelings you spare
Someone who, like it or not
Will want you to share
A little, a lot...

[SUSAN, spoken]
And what does all that mean?

[LARRY, spoken]
Robert, how do you know so much about it when you've never been there?

[HARRY, spoken]
It's much better living it than looking at it, Robert

[PETER, spoken]
Add 'em up, Bobby. Add 'em up

[ROBERT]
Someone to crowd you with love
Someone to force you to care
Someone to make you come through
Who'll always be there, as frightened as you
Of being alive
Being alive, being alive, being alive

[AMY, spoken]
Blow out the candles, Robert, and make a wish. Want something! Want something!

[ROBERT]
Somebody hold me too close
Somebody hurt me too deep
Somebody sit in my chair
And ruin my sleep
And make me aware
Of being alive, being alive

Somebody need me too much
Somebody know me too well
Somebody pull me up short
And put me through hell
And give me support
For being alive
Make me alive, make me alive

Make me confused, mock me with praise
Let me be used, vary my days
But alone is alone, not alive!

Somebody crowd me with love
Somebody force me to care
Somebody make me come through
I'll always be there
As frightened as you
To help us survive
Being alive, being alive, being alive, being alive1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Send in the Clowns

[DESIREE]
Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there
Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here
Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns
Well, maybe next year...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: A Little Priest

[MRS. LOVETT]
That's all very well, but what are we going to do about the Italian?

[TODD]
Later on, when it's dark, we'll take him out of the trunk and bury him

[MRS. LOVETT]
Well, yes, of course, we could do that. I don't suppose he's got any relatives gonna come poking around looking for him. But you know me, bright ideas just pop into my head and I keep thinking...
Seems a downright shame

[TODD]
Shame?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Seems an awful waste
Such a nice plump frame
What's his name has… had… has
Nor he can't be traced
Business needs a lift
Debts to be erased
Think of it as thrift
As a gift
If you get my drift
No?
Seems an awful waste
I mean, with the price of meat
What it is
When you get it
If you get it
[TODD]
Ha!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Good, you got it
Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop
Business never better, using only pussycats and toast
And a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste

[TODD]
Mrs. LovettWhat a charming notion
Eminently practical
And yet appropriate as always[MRS. LOVETT]
Well, it does seem a wasteMrs. Lovett
How I've lived without you all these years
I'll never knowHow delectable
Also undetectable
How choice
How rare[MRS. LOVETT]
Think about it, lots of other gentlemen'll
Soon be comin' for a shave, won't they?
Think of
All them
Pies[TODD]
For what's the sound of the world out there
[MRS. LOVETT]
What, Mr. Todd
What, Mr. Todd
What is that sound

[TODD]
Those crunching noises pervading the air

[MRS. LOVETT]
Yes, Mr. Todd!
Yes, Mr. Todd!
Yes, all around

[TODD]
It's man devouring man, my dear

[TODD/MRS. LOVETT]
And who are we to deny it in here?

[TODD]
Ah, these are desperate times, Mrs. Lovett. Desperate measure must be taken

[MRS. LOVETT]
Here we are now, hot out of the oven

[TODD]
What is that?
[MRS. LOVETT]
It's priest
Have a little priest

[TODD]
Is it really good?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Sir, it's too good, at least!
Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh
So it's pretty fresh

[TODD]
Awful lot of fat

[MRS. LOVETT]
Only where it sat

[TODD]
Haven't you got poet, or something like that?

[MRS. LOVETT]
No, y'see, the trouble with poet is
How do you know it's deceased?
Try the priest!

[TODD]
Mm, heavenly! Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, but then not as bland as curate, either!

[MRS. LOVETT]
And good for business, too; always leaves you wantin' more!
Trouble is, we only get it on Sundays!
Lawyer's rather nice

[TODD]
If it's for a price

[MRS. LOVETT]
Order something else, though, to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice!

[TODD]
Anything that's lean?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Well, then, if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine
Anyway, it's clean
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been!

[TODD]
Is that squire
On the fire?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Mercy no, sir, look closer
You'll notice it's grocer!

[TODD]
Looks thicker
More like vicar!

[MRS. LOVETT]
No, it has to be grocer
It's green!

[TODD]
The history of the world, my love

[MRS. LOVETT]
Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors!

[TODD]
Is those below serving those up above!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Ev'rybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors!

[TODD]
How gratifying for once to know

[TODD/MRS. LOVETT]
That those above will serve those down below!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Now let's see, here... We've got tinker

[TODD]
Something... pinker

[MRS. LOVETT]
Tailor?

[TODD]
Paler

[MRS. LOVETT]
Potter?

[TODD]
Hotter

[MRS. LOVETT]
Butler?

[TODD]
Subtler

[MRS. LOVETT]
Locksmith?
Lovely bit of clerk

[TODD]
Maybe for a lark
[MRS. LOVETT]
Then again there's sweep
If you want it cheap
And you like it dark!
Try the financier
Peak of his career!

[TODD]
That looks pretty rank

[MRS. LOVETT]
Well, he drank
It's a bank
Cashier
Never really sold
Maybe it was old

[TODD]
Have you any Beadle?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Next week, so I'm told!
Beadle isn't bad till you smell it and
Notice 'ow well it's been greased...
Stick to priest!
Now then, this might be a little bit stringy
But then of course it's... fiddle player!

[TODD]
No, this isn't fiddle player -- it's piccolo player!

[MRS. LOVETT]
How can you tell?

[TODD]
It's piping hot!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Then blow on it first!

[TODD]
The history of the world, my sweet

[MRS. LOVETT]
Oh, Mr. Todd
Ooh, Mr. Todd
What does it tell?

[TODD]
Is who gets eaten, and who gets to eat!

[MRS. LOVETT]
And, Mr. Todd
Too, Mr. Todd
Who gets to sell!

[TODD]
But fortunately, it's also clear

[MRS. LOVETT/TODD]
That ev'rybody goes down well with beer!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Since marine doesn't appeal to you, how about... rear admiral?

[TODD]
Too salty. I prefer general

[MRS. LOVETT]
With, or without his privates?

With is extra

[TODD]
What is that?

[MRS. LOVETT]
It's fop
Finest in the shop
Or we have some shepherd's pie peppered
With actual shepherd on top!
And I've just begun
Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily
Have one!

[TODD]
Put it on a bun
Well, you never know if it's going to run!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Try the friar
Fried, it's drier!

[TODD]
No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Then actor
It's compacter!

[TODD]
Yes and always arrives overdone!
I'll come again when you have judge on the menu

[MRS. LOVETT]
Wait, true, we don't have judge yet
But we've got something you might fancy even better

[TODD]
What is that?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Executioner!

[TODD]
Have charity towards the world, my pet!

[MRS. LOVETT]
Yes, yes, I know, my love!

[TODD]
We'll take the customers that we can get!

[MRS. LOVETT]
High-born and low, my love!

[TODD]
We'll not discriminate great from small!
No, we'll serve anyone
Meaning anyone!

[MRS. LOVETT/TODD]
And to anyone!
At all!4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Prelude: The Ballad of Sweeney Todd: “Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd”

[CITIZENS of LONDON]
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
His skin was pale and his eye was odd
He shaved the faces of gentlemen
Who never thereafter were heard of again
He trod a path that few have trod
Did Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet Street

He kept a shop in London Town
Of fancy clients and good renown
And what if none of their souls were saved?
They went to their maker impeccably shaved
By Sweeney
By Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet Street

Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!
Hold it to the skies!
Freely flows the blood of those who moralize!
His needs were few, his room was bare:
A lavabo and a fancy chair
A mug of suds and a leather strop
An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop
For neatness he deserved a nod
Did Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet Street
Inconspicuous, Sweeney was
Quick and quiet and clean, he was
Back of his smile, under his word
Sweeney heard music that nobody heard
Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned
Like a perfect machine, he planned
Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle
Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Inconspicuous, Sweeney was
Quick and quiet and clean he was
Like a perfect machine he was
Was Sweeney!
Sweeney!
Sweeney!
Sweeney!

[SWEENEY TODD]
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
He served a dark and a vengeful god
What happened then, well, that's the play
And he wouldn't want us to give it away
Not Sweeney
Not Sweeney Todd
The demon barber of Fleet StreetEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Unworthy of Your Love

[HINCKLEY, spoken (Broadway only)]
My dearest Jodie,​
I am humiliated by my weakness and my impotence. But Jodie, I can change. I'll prove to you that I can change. With one brave historic act, I will win your love, now and for all eternity.​
Love, John

[HINCKLEY]
I am nothing
You are wind and water and sky
Jodie
Tell me, Jodie
How I can earn your love
I would swim oceans
I would move mountains
I would do anything for you
What do you want me to do?

I am unworthy of your love
Jodie, Jodie
Let me prove worthy of your love
Tell me how I can earn your love
Set me free
How can I turn your love
To me?

[FROMME]
I am nothing
You are wind and devil and God
Charlie
Take my blood and my body
For your love
Let me feel fire
Let me drink poison
Tell me to tear my heart in two
If that's what you want me to do...
I am unworthy of your love
Charlie darlin'
I have done nothing for your love
Let me be worthy of your love
Set you free—

[HINCKLEY]
I would come take you from your life...

[FROMME]
I would come take you from your cell...

[HINCKLEY]
You would be queen to me, not wife...

[FROMME]
I would crawl belly deep through hell...

[HINCKLEY]
Baby, I'd die for you...

[FROMME]
Baby, I'd die for you...

[HINCKLEY]
Even though—
[FROMME]
Even though—

[BOTH]
I will always know:
I am unworthy of
Your love
Jodie darlin' (Charlie darlin')
Let me prove worthy of your love
I'll find a way to earn your love
Wait and see
Then you will turn your love to me
Your love to me...

[HINCKLEY, spoken (Broadway only)]
He died so our love could live.​

[REAGAN, spoken (Broadway only)]
Sorry Nancy, looks like I forgot to duck.​
I sure hope that surgeon's a Republican.​
Where'd that kid learn to shoot, the Russian Army?
There ya' go again.​
There ya' go again.​
There ya' go again.​EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Pirelli’s Miracle Elixir

[TOBIAS]
Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention please?
Do you wake every morning in shame and despair
To discover your pillow is covered with hair
What ought not to be there?
Well, ladies and gentlemen
From now on you can waken with ease
You need never again have a worry or care
I will show you a miracle marvelous rare
Gentlemen, you are about to see something that rose from the dead
On the top of my head

Scarcely a month ago, gentlemen
I was suddenly struck with a rare oriental disease
Though the finest physicians in London were called
I awakened one morning amazed and appalled
To discover with dread that my head was as bald
As a novice's knees!
I was dying of shame
Till a gentleman came
An illustrious barber, Pirelli by name
He gave me a liquid as precious as gold
I rubbed it in daily like what I was told
And behold!
Only thirty days old!
'Twas Pirelli's Miracle elixir
That's what did the trick, sir
True, sir, true
Was it quick, sir?
Did it in a tick, sir
Just like an elixir ought to do
How about a bottle, mister?
Only costs a penny, guaranteed[COMPANY]
Penny buys a bottle, I don't know
You don't need, ah, let's go[TOBIAS]
Go ahead and tug, sir
Go ahead, sir, harder[TOBIAS]
Does Pirelli's stimulate the growth, sir?
You can have my oath, sir
'Tis unique
Rub a minute
Stimulating, in'it?
Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week
Penny buys a bottle, guaranteed

[COMPANY]
Penny buys a bottle, might as well
I just did

[TOBIAS]
Gently dab it, gets to be a 'abit
Soon there'll be enough, sir
Somebody can grab it
See this chap with hair like Shelley's?
You can tell he's used Pirelli's
[COMPANY]
Let me have a bottle
Make that two

[TODD]
Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?

[MRS. LOVETT]
Are we standing near an open trench?

[TOBIAS]
Buy Pirelli's Miracle elixir
Anything what's slick, sir
Soon sprouts curls
Try Pirelli's
When they see how thick, sir
You can have your pick, sir
Of the girls
Wanna buy a bottle, missus?

[TODD]
What is this?

[MRS. LOVETT]
What is this?
[TODD]
Smells like piss

[MRS. LOVETT]
Smells like—phew!

[COMPANY]
He says it smells like piss
What d'you think?
[TODD]
This is piss. Piss with ink

[COMPANY]
What is this?
Where is this Pirelli?
Yes, where is this Pirelli?

[TOBIAS]
Let Pirelli's
Activate your roots, sir

[TODD]
Keep it off your boots, sir
Eats right through

[COMPANY]
Go and get Pirelli

[TOBIAS]
Yes, get Pirelli's
Use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it

[MRS LOVETT]
Flies do too

[COMPANY]
Get the bloody money off him
Get the bloody money off him

[TOBIAS]
See Pirelli's Miracle elixir
Grow a little wick, sir
Then some fuzz
The Pirelli's
Soon'll make it thick, sir
Like a good elixir
Always does!
Trust Pirelli's
If your hair is sick, sir
Fix it in the nick, sir
Don't look grim
Just Pirelli's Miracle elixir
That'll do the trick, sir—

[COMPANY]
What about the money?

[TOBIAS]
If you've got it a kick, sir—

[COMPANY]
What about the money?
Where is this Pirelli?
Go and get Pirelli!

[TOBIAS]
Tell it to the mixer
Of the miracle elixir
If you've got a kick, sir
[COMPANY]
What about the money?
Where is this Pirelli?

Song title: Not While I’m Around

[TOBY]
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around
Nothing's gonna harm you
No, sir, not while I'm around
Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays
I'll send them howling
I don't care
I got ways

[MRS. LOVETT]
Of course you do! What a sweet, affectionate child it is!

[TOBY]
No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle I'll be there
Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while
But in time
Nothing can harm you
Not while I'm around

Not to worry
Not to worry
I may not be smart
But I ain't dumb
I can do it
Put me to it
Show me something I can overcome
Not to worry, Mum
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true
I don't need to
I would never
Hide a thing from you
Like some
[MRS. LOVETT]
Now, now, stop all this foolish chatter and just sit here, nice and quiet
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around
Nothing's gonna harm you, Toby
Not while I'm around

[TOBY]
Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays
I'll send 'em howling
I don't care

[MRS. LOVETT]
Boys and their fancies. What will we think of next?

[TOBY]
No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle I'll be there
Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while
But in time
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: The Ladies Who Lunch

[JOANNE]
Here's to the ladies who lunch—
Everybody laugh
Lounging in their caftans
And planning a brunch
On their own behalf
Off to the gym
Then to a fitting
Claiming they're fat
And looking grim
'Cause they've been sitting
Choosing a hat
Does anyone still wear a hat?
I'll drink to that

And here's to the girls who play smart—
Aren't they a gas?
Rushing to their classes in optical art,
Wishing it would pass
Another long exhausting day
Another thousand dollars
A matinee, a Pinter play
Perhaps a piece of Mahler's
I'll drink to that
And one for Mahler!
And here's to the girls who play wife—
Aren't they too much?
Keeping house but clutching a copy of LIFE
Just to keep in touch
The ones who follow the rules
And meet themselves at the schools
Too busy to know that they're fools
Aren't they a gem?
I'll drink to them!
Let's all drink to them!

And here's to the girls who just watch—
Aren't they the best?
When they get depressed
It's a bottle of Scotch
Plus a little jest
Another chance to disapprove
Another brilliant zinger
Another reason not to move
Another vodka stinger
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
I'll drink to that

So here's to the girls on the go—
Everybody tries
Look into their eyes
And you'll see what they know:
Everybody dies
A toast to that invincible bunch
The dinosaurs surviving the crunch.
Let's hear it for the ladies who lunch—
Everybody rise!
Rise!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!
Rise!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Sunday in the Park with George

[GEORGE, spoken]
White, a blank page or canvas
The challenge, bring order to the whole
Through Design
Composition
Tension
Balance
Light
And Harmony

[DOT, spoken]
George
Why is it you always get to sit in the shade
While I have to stand in the sun?
Hello George
There is someone in this dress

(sung)
A trickle of sweat
The back of the head
He always does this
Now the foot is dead
Sunday in the park with George
One more Su-

The collar is damp
Beginning to pinch
The bustle's slipping
I won't budge one inch
Who was at the zoo, George?
Who was at the zoo?
The monkeys and who, George?
The monkeys and who?

[GEORGE, spoken]
Don't move!

[DOT]
Artists are bizarre. Fixed. Cold. 
That's you, George, you're bizarre. Fixed. Cold. 
I like that in a man
Fixed. Cold. 
God, it's hot out here

Well, there are worse things
Than staring at the water on a Sunday
There are worse things
Than staring at the water
As you're posing for a picture
Being painted by your lover
In the middle of the summer
On an island in the river on a Sunday!

The petticoat's wet
Which adds to the weight
The sun is blinding
All right, concentrate...
[GEORGE, spoken]
Eyes open, please.

Sunday in the park with George!

[GEORGE]
Look out at the water, not at me

[DOT]
Sunday in the park with George!

Well, if you want bread
And respect
And attention
Not to say connection
Modeling's no profession

If you want instead
When you're dead
Some more public and more permanent expression
Of affection
You want a painter
Poet
Sculptor, preferably:
Marble, granite, bronze
Durable
Something nice with swans
That's durable
Forever
All it has to be is good
And George, you're good
You're really good

George's stroke is tender
George's touch is pure

Your eyes, George
I love your eyes, George
I love your beard, George
I love your size, George
But most, George
Of all
But most of all
I love your painting...
I think I'm fainting...

The tip of a stay
Right under the tit
No, don't give in, just
Lift the arm a bit...

[GEORGE, spoken]
Don't lift the arm, please. 

[DOT]
Sunday in the park with George!

[GEORGE, spoken]
The bustle high, please. 

[DOT]
Not even a nod
As if I were trees
The ground could open
He would still say "please"

Never know with you, George
Who could know with you?
The others I knew, George
Before we get through
I'll get to you too
God, I am so hot!

Well there are worse things
Than staring at the water on a Sunday
There are worse things
Than staring at the water
As you're posing for a picture
After sleeping on the ferry
After getting up at seven
To come over to an island
In the middle of a river
Half an hour from the city
On a Sunday
On a Sunday in the park with-

[GEORGE, spoken]
Don't move the mouth!
