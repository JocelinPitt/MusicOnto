Song title: Twisted

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem (Yelawolf)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a—
She (Don't give a shit)
[Verse 2: Skylar Grey, Eminem & Harmonizing]
Sometimes I wish that you would just die
'Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good, all you are to me is a
[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a—

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo—smokin' blow with Antonio
In a back-alley, takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Uh, feel like I've been asleep and alone
And lovin' this angel, entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
Round and round we roll
Where it stops, baby, nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just wanna free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside, 'cause
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem (Yelawolf)]
She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a—
She (Don't give a shit)

[Outro: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
But maybe I'm the twisted one
That screwed this up
So, I guess, this means goodbye...
For now

Song title: Kill for You

[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
In my eyes
Even if you are wrong, you are right
Even if it's a terrible crime, it's alright
Cause I got your back, and I know you got mine
I belong to the church of your name, Sing a song
'Cause I worship the ground you walk on
If I pray for you, I know you'll be there
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you
[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
In my bed I believe every word that you've said
Just a kiss and you make me forget
All the bad, the battles we lost, the bodies we hid
You don't know, just how far I'd be willing to go
You put the cracks into my moral code
So you can count on me to always be there
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
Oh, lord, forgive my weary hands
And for what they may do
I'll carry out his evil plans
If he wants me to
[Verse 3: Eminem]
In your dream, you're drownin', I just waltz in and saved you
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to
Your ultimate savior, your behavior is altered
Ain't your fault 'cause I made you
Brainwash and persuade you
Gibraltar, your faith'll never falter or waver
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel
Nobody can tell you shit, you've already made your
Mind just follow me, babe, you
Won't be sorry you stayed, you
Always ride, whatever the plan is
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush
Even if we robbed a First National and cops caught us redhanded
They're coming at us, and we're trapped with our backs up
Against the wall, and it's too tall
You'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
Stay back to get captured, take the fall
You make it all worth it
Baby doll, you're perfect the way you are
Accidents happen
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
Who tries to take your man from you
It's blasphemy, another casualty, you'll go whatever route
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me
I never doubt that
That's 'cause you
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
You could make me a believer
Even if that shit ain't true
You could make me commit murder
Baby, I'd kill for you

Song title: Everything I Need

[Verse 1]
Born on the wrong side of the ocean
With all the tides against you
You never thought you'd be much good for anyone
But that's so far from the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know there's pain in your heart
And you're covered in scars
Wish you could see what I do

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need

[Verse 2]
You can say I'm wrong
You can turn your back against me
But I am here to stay
(I am here to stay)
Like the sea
She keeps kissing the shoreline
No matter how many times he pushes her away
[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me

[Bridge]
And everything happens for a reason
It's all a blessing in disguise
I used to question who I was
But now I see
The answer's in your eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, everything you are
Is everything I need
You're everything to me
Baby, every single part
Is who you're meant to be
'Cause you were meant for me
And you're everything I need4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: C’mon Let Me Ride

[Intro: Skylar Grey]
And the wheels go around and 'round, and 'round

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
If you got a sweet tooth, you can taste my watermelons
If the swingset bores you, I can show you all my talents
I can wear a tan like other bitches can't
You can have all this, boy and there’s only one thing that I want from you

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C'mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike
(Ha-ha!)

[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last like other bitches can’t
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you, hey
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
I’m only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it’s true
I’m not like the sluts in this town
They make me blech in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
‘Cause you’re the boy that I like
It’s like I’m a sellout for you
But your bike’s so shiny and new (Shiny and new)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Skylar Grey]
She’s distracted, by my reflectors
Man, I can tell this chick’s attracted
My wheels spoke to her, my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging’s not something I'm a pro at, but I ain’t practicing shit
Allen Iverson of safe sex
Condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gaggin’, they call me the broad killer
I’m the cousin of Godzilla
‘Cause I spit fire and my dick’s draggin', zig-zaggin' up the avenue
Pullin’ these chicks in my antagonist wagon, screamin’
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it’s only natural
I feel it comin’, comin’ comin’, ohh
I feel it runnin’, runnin’, runnin’, oh!
C’mon, let me ride your bicycle
It’s so fantastical, on your bicycle, whoa!

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike
You want to ride my bicycle, you want to ride my bike, ha ha19EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Wreak Havoc

[Verse 1]
They call me a menace
They say that I’m cursed
But somethin' about me is makin' 'em jealous
So listen and learn
I herd 'em like cattle
Cause I’m surrounded by cowards
And I don’t give a fuck when I walk into battle
And thats why I got all the power
I’m where you wanna be
Ain’t no one ahead of me
All of my enemies made a decision
It's better to follow me
I make no apologies
All of my sins I would repeat and I repeat
Cause I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard
[Verse 2]
I dine with the blood on my hands
Thrive when I’m beatin' the man
All I learned in the pen
Is never get caught
Just get out and hit it again
Straight outta context
Ain't see me come like it's phone sex
Ain't hear me tick like a Rolex
Cause I’m keepin' a nuclear conscience
I fly like an atom bomb
In a world riddled with conflict
Hate that you need me
Wanna destroy me but you can’t
You're gonna deploy me in the end
Better believe that I'ma be me 'til the death of me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard
Die hard
[Bridge]
And if love is real
Maybe I’m just too bad
To remember how good it feels
My heart is still

[Chorus]
I can smell your fear
The only reason that I’m here
Is to wreak havoc
Everybody prayin' that I’ll change, yeah
Maybe one day but tomorrow I’ll be back at it
Cause bad habits they die hard
We live fast we die hard
Go against me you’ll die hard

Song title: Love the Way You Lie, Pt. III (Original Demo)

[Verse 1]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then the saint turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
And glasses shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: I Know You

[Verse 1]
I believe, I believe there's love in you
Gridlocked on the dusty avenues
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more than innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways that you don't know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't complicate it
Don't let the past dictate
Yeah
I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith

[Chorus]
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

[Verse 2]
I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on the road to misery
And what I gave to you
I could never get back
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't complicate it
Don't drive yourself insane
Yeah
Say what you will but I know that you want to stay

[Chorus]
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

[Bridge]
Chemicals rushing in
I know it's you that I belong to (I belong to)
I'm burning like a cannonball in the air
Crashing into who I belong to (Belong)
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
I have been patient, but slowly I'm losing faith
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please
(The shadows of your heart are hanging in the sweet, sweet air)
I know you baby
I know you baby
So please
(The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair)
I know you baby
I know you baby
The shadows of your heart are hanging in the sweet, sweet air
(I know you baby)
I know you baby
The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair

Song title: Coming Home, Pt. II

[Verse 1]
And the blood will dry, underneath my nails
And the wind will rise up, to fill my sails

[Pre-Chorus]
See you can doubt, and you can hate
But I know, no matter what it takes

[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

[Verse 2]
Still far away, from where I belong
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
See you can doubt, and you can hate
But I know, no matter what it takes
[Chorus]
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away, all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes

Song title: Words

[Verse 1]
Always in a rush
Never stay on the phone long enough
Why am I so self-important?
Said I'd see you soon
But that was, oh, maybe a year ago
Didn't know time was of the essence

[Pre-Chorus]
So many questions
But I'm talking to myself
I know that you can't hear me anymore
Not anymore
So much to tell you
And most of all goodbye
But I know that you can't hear me anymore

[Chorus]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I never said
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 2]
Always talking shit
Took your advice and did the opposite
Just being young and stupid
I haven't been all that you could've hoped for
But if you'd held on a little longer
You'd have had more reasons to be proud
[Pre-Chorus]
So many questions
But I'm talking to myself
I know that you can't hear me anymore
Not anymore
So much to tell you
And most of all goodbye
But I know that you can't hear me anymore

[Chorus]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words

[Bridge]
The longer I stand here
The louder the silence
I know that you're gone but sometimes I swear that I hear
Your voice when the wind blows
So I talk to the shadows
Hoping you might be listening 'cos I want you to know

[Chorus]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
And as I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I never said
I can't take back the words I never said
Never said
I can't take back the words I never said12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
