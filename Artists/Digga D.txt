Song title: No Diet

[Intro]
Ghosty
Cop it, lock it, sell it
Rob it, fly it
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain’t diet

[Chorus]
Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it (Bubu)
Cop it, lock it, sell it (The money)
Rob it, fly it (Brrr)
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet (No Diet)

[Verse 1]
You know-you know seh the gun then buss
Lean, lean with the gun like Russ
No one ain’t dyin', they're lyin' on us
No carb in the yard then I'm flyin' it dust (Whi-pow)
Truss, no loyalty, she's linin' ’em up
No royalty, your queen give it up
Cheff chest and back, I’m leavin' him rubbed (Ching, ching, ching)
Up and down, no seesaw
Detour, oi, dodge that nee-naw
I got six and if you add three more
Then I’m somewhere where I might get recalled
And I'm tired of seein' the can
Whole ting get shell down
(Woi-woi-woi-woi-woi-woi)
Got the fairy .44, big bang (Bubu)
Bro don't box like Joshua, shank game popular
Do man proper, shotta
Throw me a box and I got ya
Man take risks for the pounds and prosper
Prosper, they had me in the can like Foster
Let the Star buck for the cream, no Costa (Cream)
That nigga don’t really want beef
Who's copyin' me? Some silly imposter
[Chorus]
Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it (Bubu)
Cop it, lock it, sell it (The money)
Rob it, fly it (Brrr)
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet (No Diet)
Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it (Bubu)
Cop it, lock it, sell it (The money)
Rob it, fly it (Brrr)
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet (No Diet)

[Verse 2]
Spill some juice, KA
And it was a carnival crush when bro CJ got three in a day (Ching)
Seventeen with a .38 (Bow)
Praying that they come my way
.32, .25's and .40's
Conceived in the nineties (Nineties)
Born in the noughties
Cover these tats' when I'm goin' on walkies
No porkies, jail house filled stories
OT, hit town, need more fiends
So I'm on the M, switch lane like Tory (Skrr)
Bill up my spot and I'm leavin' it gory
Surely, surely
Bro's faster, he'll do it before me (Neeaw)
You want it? I got it, call me
I whip it and lock it at Pauly's
This one's feelin' horny
Got a rusty ting from South with the mouth
She ain't gettin' more than Morleys
I'ma buss in her mouth by all means
[Chorus]
Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it (Bubu)
Cop it, lock it, sell it (The money)
Rob it, fly it (Brrr)
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet (No Diet)
Whip it, set it
Flick it, cheff it
Cop it, chop it, press it (Bubu)
Cop it, lock it, sell it (The money)
Rob it, fly it (Brrr)
Drop it, dry it
It's there on demand, I supply it
You know the coke ain't diet (No Diet)14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Mad About Bars

[Intro: Kenny Allstar]
Mad About Bars
I know you lot have been waiting for this one
Ghosty
And believe me we ain't leaving, until we got another classic
So Digga D, let's give the streets what they really want
Mad About Bars, we're back
Cut tru' Digga

[Verse]
If they get nicked with the cannon
They won't stay real and sing like Mariah
Conspire to change my attire
Rise that fryer and burn that liar
Bro known rider
He got down three and they all turned choir
And prior, prior, prior to this sixteen or higher
The opps turned bro to a lifer
300s, leathers on, no biker
And I was the only guy my age in West London with a sniper
See a man's eyes roll back from a chest shot attack
Free broski Striker
Or I press on a one .32
But I ain't tryna find out my number on Lyca
Them man act for the net
But that's not how they are off set
And when me and my amigos pull up
They take off, make off, they're wet
Still bake off where shh got cheffed
Trap pays off, I still get bread
No days off, I miss my bed
Still blaze off, ay, fling that lead
Who's dem yutes? Spin that ped
Do it like Bruce, ching that head
I learnt from Cruz now I bring back Zs
Bro drop mad work, that weight get benched
Do it like Ratlin, hop that fence
But I bet you still get ching-ching
So it don't make no sense
So it don't make no sense
Got a pack just in, that's Bieber
On a Friday battering fish
But the Sunday coming ain't Easter
Little bro don't know how to whip
He wants white wash, no FIFA
He told me he got it on tick
Ay, take that shit and go buy a new beater
Caasis, caasis, the akhis call us caasis
Askar tryna raid mans guri, they want man back in xabsi
Grab the xabad, I'm charged up fully
Mask and hoodie, jump out the passy
Really tryna bullet that boy
No Walters, I ain't doing up Ashley
I look psychotic when man get wassy
I need me a stain, now I'm searching, Finding Nemo
Add bash to the Bobby
See man got brown, no Nino
His silk gon' cut when I back that smoke
The nurse ain't using chemo
Don got dipped cah he tried run
I caught him a stitch, no Lilo
How much do you wanna B-E-T if I step on a Five with a Star
Suttin' gon' end up on BBC if I tell bro stop that car
Film in the four, two guns, take one, we're rolling
Lights, camera, action, cut-cut when I soak him
Ian's proper, every morning phones my blower
Food on fleek, take two of each, I call that Noah
Twelve for a oner, or take more, I don't go no lower
And if Drip don't answer his phone
Then I'm all alone tryna bring back yola
Pyrex living, Pyrex whipping
Splash in the kitchen, get it back over
Brown and cute like Keisha
I can't lie Lisa, a real life moaner
Been getting these P's, ten point five of the baking soda
She wan' jump up, mash up the place
Pallance bitch, this ain't no soca

Song title: Daily Duppy

Part 1

[Intro]
Ace Beats
Ace Beats
Yo, look

[Verse]
Fresh home, still using a kettle to whip, this fish ain't nothin' like tuna
Would've been more than meddling kids if Kruger taught me to whip up sooner
I don't trap with melanin kids, the rumour is Digga D is a groomer
I just mixed two five two with sixty, the boy Adz just ran for a tuna
And that's actually factual
Pyrex filled with oil, in jail, mixed that with mackerel
In Feltham using foil, in big man jail, man broke my capsule
ZK shoulda been at school, he left that place when cats called
Why? We all sold, drugs it's natural
Jheeze, I just got released
No more selling bariis, or hearing the govs with keys
And now I can rest in peace (Yeah, yeah)
Just like my paigons, it's haram for us to eat pork
But it ain't haram for them to get bacon, don't get cooked or shaven
Been in the field like Niko Bellic, real yard man like Jacob (Mm-mm)
Don't get chopped like Franklin's dog cah your soul might just get taken
Not green but Grove, my opps are broke
They ain't ballers, it's blatant
We got a CJ from Grove as well, but we ain't in San Andreas (Free him up)
Jojo got an L plate, he ain't even got his provisional license (Yeah)
Watch me whip this skeng and his head back jerk pin drop, that's nothing but silence
Five guys step on violence, GBK get bun, no Byrons
My young boys do what I say, I'm Simon, charged up and vibrant
We ain't sharing a drink when I let that sky, watch his head back tilt
They had my man cold outside, had to cover that kid in a quilt
She lined me and her juice got spilt, I lost no sleep, I don't feel no guilt
Ah shit, she need some milk, case dismissed before it got built
I got a dotty off one of my Eastenders but the son of a gun's not Nick
The queen that I want ain't Vick but I still make that on the square like Mick
My little shooter's in his prime time, if I send him now, TV at six (Check the news)
Like, how's he got so much talk on the 'net? Like he ain't been touched with a flicks
Old school days never had me a Rollie, I bought that aqua fresh (Yeah, yeah)
I told her (i told her)  "I want Oral B", now she's all on me and she's making a mess
She said that it's big for a slender, easy, I'm tender, don't undress
Ejaculate in her mouth or pull out, ejaculate on her breast, yes
Part 2

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
HONEYWOODSIX
Look, yo, blue woo, blue woo

[Verse]
About ten for a show, come correct
Show respect, forty for a feature, I'm the hardest, what did you expect? (Yo, pay that)
I had hitters on the wing but I still made a ching
Fuck my future, didn't think, I just cheffed his neck (I got payback)
Spent forty on my car too, would've spent more if my insurance let me pass through
The other day, I was looking at a Lambo truck
In the showroom, with my rambo tucked
Shar said cut my hair and go back to the fuckboy trim (Nope)
Far from a fuckboy, you know I bust my spin (Dun' know)
I take L's in the field but I got more wins (Yup)
Shot a tape for half a milly and I bought more tings (Yeah, yeah)
This rap shit bringin' more bit shots (More)
Banging Buju banton, two bricks copped (Both of them)
Before rap, it was fawners and corners
Some used a phone box so I answered, no callers
Mum's life, let my gun rise, I get busy
So much guns, I had to share some with killy (Kind)
Ask them, so much guns, man run out places to park skengs
Two peb phones, man's renting them a rack a week each
Only 'cause they keep interrupting my sleep
And, bro, I want my little brothers to eat
But yo, I ain't givin' them a handout
When I needed a hand in, who brought bands out? (Who?)
There we go, you hear me, bro
I named a .44 long merry-go rounds
Only one will turn your head into a cheerio
Right wrist, twenty, left like sixty, basically seventy
And I don't like girls my age unless it's Maya or Tennessee
The rest in the U.K. just look dead to me
So I fly the foreigns in (Yup)
Smashed same day, I forgot they had to quarantine
And I got shooters on my team (Yup)
Bait guys, left five shell casings on the scene (Woi, woi, woi, woi)
You ain't never had to watch 45Hickok (Yup)
Had me feelin' like a nigga got ripped off (Nope)
But I was using wrong shells, I was buzzin' cah I never had the name at the side of the somethin'
I grew up listening to Cowboy and BP (Killy niggas)
Then it turned to Little Reese and Chief Keef (Chicago)
Fourteen, really in the streets, knees deep
Puttin' four bills down and that was each week (Yeah, trappy wit' it)
My opps gettin' chatty wit' it
I'm just gettin' slappy wit' it
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, nah, I'm gettin' Dappy wit' it2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Now I'm rollin', handgun, shells golden
Five door hatchback, lurk in the Astra
Five man dash back, might be a hashtag
Lay low, bro just chinged up F****
Yo, I really wanna kill this gasbag
I told little Stizzy to go be the lookout (Look, go look, go look)
Cah I ain't tryna lose this telly
Ask Unknown T, my celly
If I had my man lookin' like Nelly
I chinged my man on house block four
Turn that wing to a Hotspur (Done him up)
No Tottenham but it came from a farm
Same size as my arm, it's a Mossberg
[Chorus]
See a opp right thurr
And get chingy, chingy, chingy (Don't leave him)
My gun dem with me, my gun den fi me
Give me my thingy and let me get flingy (Yeah)
Ya see it? Ya zimme? (Yeah)
We got a big dilemma
Bait main road, bro don't know better
Looked at bro like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
He let that go like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
Bait main road like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever (Bluuwuu, Bluuwuu)

[Verse 2]
Yo, whatever the weather, I'm steppin' whenever
I'm madder than ever
Ruin his sweater, put two in the 'Retta
They're copyin' me 'cause I'm doin' it better
Left my block with the pum pum rev out
Can't come in 'til the killy dem dead up
One hand in, can't get the left leg up
They're drawin' me in, they don't want me to step out
Wait, that's him, I swear? (What?)
Where? Right thurr (Oh, yeah)
Jump out, try put him in a coffin
Hop back in and swerve
Where's my 'yac? (Where's my 'yac?)
I'm burst (Yeah, yeah)
Last night was a blur (Blur)

I'm about to go clear
[Chorus]

Looked at bro like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"
He let that go like, "It's whatever, it's whatever, it's whatever"

Still mix Amnesia weed with cigs (The ammi smells)

White boy wasted crew and we roll in cars, ragging them like they're stolen
Barbies bleach blonde, Phil Foden
Makin' them scream that "It's comin' home" and that (And that)
I told Digga to roll with that (With that)
'Cause I'm so fuckin' off my nut, I might just lack
I don't shoot no wap, beer bottles get smashed
So let's have it (Let's have it)
You don't wanna party with ArrDee, none of 'em hack it (None)
It's litty for really, it's silly, if you got a drink and I see it, I'll back it (Back)
Necking it off just like the gyal in my bed that I've got
Tun up with tugs and geezers', the lot
My own family think I've lost the plot, I don't give a toss
Leave the girl breathing heavy, easy, steady (It's bait)
I don't know about stayin' out late, 'cause I party 'til the sunrise
This boy, have the cab man screaming (Woi, woi, woi)
It's litty for really, a whole bag of noise
The vibes in the room but Digga's too loose
Heard man say
[Chorus: Digga D]
I-I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun
If you try to run, I'm kweffing you, I-I shoot my gun
I ain't cheffing you, I shoot, I-I shoot my gun

Song title: Fire In The Booth

Part 1

[Intro: Charlie Sloth & Digga D]
You know what time it is when you hear this right
Let's get ready to rumble
Digga D in the building
Double Tap Diaries out there right now man
Right now, grab that, No Diet
Your name's ringing out there Digga
Come on
Let's go bro, let's get 'em, let's go
Look
Round one, let's turn up bro
Listen

[Verse 1]
We ain't in Puerto Rico, let me tell you this West Side story
I ain't talking Finding Nemo but they just keep swimming like Dory
Just keep swimming, keep swinging
Just keep chinging, push that blade deep in him
We know, they know, I know
How much times they swam outside? Them boy love lido
I know, they know, we know CJ got all three, no Migos
Now it's CJ on free flow
Don't get stitched like Lilo and then snitch, stick to the G-code
Need me a reload, trap, jugg for a kilo
I'll catch me a M for the hunchos, I got hundos stacked from Nino
Nino Brown, it's peak when we come 'round
I feel like bro, the way that I got him down
Me and my cartel pull up, pop corn where they're holding the vibes
I'm black still moving Charlie, Charlie wing I was movin' spice
I heard there's a bounty, I might tell ***** take that ******
If my trap phone's saying it's busy, it's signal, I'm always running my line
Just got me a pipe, got a star in the hood like Strydes
Bro don't run out of bars like Chip, slick, he won't have less than nine
And I ain't a youngen no more, the phones I control are mine
I bish-bash-bosh the Buj, I stack and stay on my grind
I bish-bash-bosh, the B's lethal and it's one of a kind
Jeepers Creepers, we keepers on whatever we find
I took them waps and turned them mine
Man can't press on my buttons, I'll press on my suttin', no comment to swine
I hit five inches away from his spine
Splash-splash, yuck-yuck, who's that? Jakes? Oi, duck-duck
Bro don't run out of breath, stress, he might just run out of luck
I'm tired of seeing these govs, I just left Wano, you just left Scrubs
Felts, cooks swinging our plugs, outside charge, I'm seeing the judge
Real niggas know that I've kept up fuckery, bun mans skin point blank with the brucky
Been tryna turn man duppy, watch his blood splatter, that's lovely
I just come back from country, my toes dem stink and my hair looks grubby
And I feel like to get down bro when I came back home and my dick was rusty
I can rap that stuff cah I done that, catch man lacking and bun that
Man can't talk 'bout worker, see the phone's that I got? Man run that
Yosh got the wheel, we skrring, drove past an opp, clock, turn and spun that
Tell bro put his foot on the clutch and put it in 1 when you see man run back
Blood on my shank, man keep it and clean it, shot that shit if I'm paro'
All of my hittas are hungry, get your shit jacked like Sparrow
Shotty come long like Hunch', chop that barrel and the back of the handle
I hate taking L's, this flip can't flop like sandals
Push bike with a 15 inch, T-T make the phoneline ring so I serve them
Can't question my workers work rate, all I do is divert them
Can't question my badness, see the straps that I got? Man earnt them
You won't do it for the gang, that's certain
Go do it for your mum, that's urgent

Part 2

[Interlude: Digga D & Charlie Soth]
Come on
Come on, man like Digga D in the building
I see you my guy
Streets been waiting for this one forreal, forreal
Forreal man
Forreal, forreal and we're just warming on 'em bro
M1OnTheBeat
Round 2, final lap Digga
Let's show them why you're that guy right now bruh
Listen
Crash that corn, that's BA, in EA, it's in the game
Drip, drip like my chain
Two bells in the gauge
Come on
Listen, look

[Verse 1]
I got beef with white yutes but I got black opps too
If I get that call of duty, pull up and crash, no Bandicoot
Been dodging the obbo, you know how much sims that man ran through?
Keep that one on the low, that bro gets dough and you have no clue
My ting won't jam well I wanted *****, there's no need for speed
Splash him, assassin, man don't box like Creed
T-T, this grub ain't draggin' from a ball to a Z
No, I don't play in the station, you can't throw dirt on we
I trap, you F, see the difference?
I planned that getaway proper, I just tried pack man from a distance
I'm a bully, food get teken', swing that weapon, I need more assistance
Largest pokey when the M, he's too on, bro don't listen
Look how we done it with L1, I'm sure that we got R too
R1 or 3 double 0, I'll press, come try when I'm passing through
What's the angle? No Randall in my circle, I'll shoot
I'll shoot, press the O, the same way I do it with food
Don't run with your girl, get your princess cut, old school, I used to see Z's
Now it's straight Nina's and up, yo, let's shine like VVS'
You know that's flawless grub, I took her VS1
Ball in her tongue, flawless uck and her pum-pum's fat as fuck
So much smoke in the ride it's got two decks, I'll let that buss'
You don't wanna see that flash so stay in you lane and you won't get touched
Popo know it ain't them, they keep fucking blaming us
Whenever the corn get buss' they kick up a fuss, panic and dust
[Outro: Charlie Sloth & Digga D]
Come on
Come on
Digga D
You get me
I see you my guy, Double Tap Diaries out right now
Right now, No Diet
Go get the ting, go get the ting
Oi, bro it's been a beautiful year for you already man
Truss me
Come on, just gotta make sure you stay around, make sure it stays beautiful
Defo
I see you bro, Double Tap Diaries out there right now, it's important
You done your thing bro, shut it down forreal, forreal
And that right there, that right there is Fire In The Booth3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Intro: Digga D, Striker]
CGM
Turn it up in my headphones please a little bit
Big Strikes, bang
Big pipes on big bikes, fuck the ****
(Sixteen in this ****)

[Chorus]
Blu, bluuwuu
I can't flag what the opps dem flaggin'
Take me in when I talk on beats, trust me, it's more than rapping

[Verse 1]
I won't roll with my gun and not use it (Not use it)
I roll with my **** and I use it (Abuse it)
I had a little dots when I buck *** ****
Let it off then, cross the **** ******
Numerous shootings, the mandem do this, trust me, it's more than music (Yeah, yeah)
Why you think I'm not liked in the industry? Cah I'm in the streets with the shooters (With the shooters!)
I see my man and my man chilling with my man, they're all wet so man don't care (Wet)
If I ask them who have they bun, that's the convo done right there (Period)
Can't ask me "Who have you bun?" I'ma look at you dumb like "Reh" (Delirious)
Don't you know who I am? I'm Shotgun Shane, I don't squeeze my gun in the air (I'm serious)
Why am I shootin' God for? (Why?)
Will never make up, no contour (Never)
This Off-White's from offshore
Cats call back for an encore (They do)
Five jails, one year, been on tour, walk in the store and buy out the shop floor (Buy it)
White tee from Paris, bonjour, ten gone, it's calm, I got more (I got it)
[Chorus]
Blu, bluuwuu
I can't flag what the opps dem flaggin'
Take me in when I talk on beats, trust me, it's more than rapping
Blu, bluuwuu
This one's old like *****
I see my man turn into Usain Bolt and ****** turn into Gatlin
Blu, bluuwuu
I can't flag what the opps dem flaggin'
Take me in when I talk on beats, trust me, it's more than rapping
Blu, bluuwuu
This one's old like *****
I see my man turn into Usain Bolt and ****** turn into Gatlin

[Verse 2]
When I saw ****, I was gassed like when I saw Nicki (Nicki)
I flew out the ride with my flicky, stiff buck fifty and then skidded off quickly
Scene left red, if you run and get trippy
He stayed and got bun, must have been smoking bariis like *****
Bang that wap, saw BA takeoff (Bap)
I weren't in Heathrow or Gatwick (Nope)
I'm chattin' bout ****
I made him run 'way when I slapped it (Dickhead)
Open the back bit, stuffed it and tapped it (Bap, bap), I'm too active
I was gonna fuck **** twice, but I realised that the one there a catfish (She's smelly)
Might be with the angels if I fire this ting in my palm (Then dash the firearm)
I'm in a hotel with smoke, bae, don't worry 'bout the fire alarm (Just cool)
She told her mates there's poles in the place, ooh, that's warm (Ooh)
I forgot that girls are chatty, had the wap out like everything's calm (Ahh)
[Chorus]
Blu, bluuwuu
I can't flag what the opps dem flaggin'
Take me in when I talk on beats, trust me, it's more than rapping
Blu, bluuwuu
This one's old like *****
I see my man turn into Usain Bolt and ****** turn into Gatlin
Blu, bluuwuu
I can't flag what the opps dem flaggin'
Take me in when I talk on beats, trust me, it's more than rapping
Blu, bluuwuu
This one's old like *****
I see my man turn into Usain Bolt and ****** turn into Gatlin

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm Double Tap in 2k17 (Bap)
The difference is this machine got a long arse magazine (Grr, grr)

We had London screaming T******, they don't care 'bout what it means (Hahaha)

[Verse 1]
If you tell me one man, just one man, that you shot, then I'll never rap again
I don't wanna hear that cap again
Roll up, lift the pole up and slap at them (Grr, grr, rollin')
No bells for the nina, bring the dagger dem
Yo, I don't know who them boy think they're badder than (What?)
Get me mad again (What?), get me mad again
So I can ching mans chest and back again (Yeah, yeah)
Too real for the scene, they ain't seen what I seen
Whistle on pistol with the beam (Bo-boom)
Crib Session, I had the machine
Daily Duppy, I went with a full magazine (Grr, grr, grr)
Four-fizzy on FRE
The four-five if man don't free up the C.R.E.A.M (Yo, gimme that)
We slimed out ****, then ****, they're callin' us robbery team
Please stop botherin' me, did I hit that stain? Well, obviously
Jokes, I ain't do none of that, B
Cah these niggas snitchin' anonymously
Drill, I'm runnin' it prominently
Man bully these rappers, that's dominancy (Yeah)
I'll go to a show with a dotty on me
Fucked up, tell them boy "Stop copyin' me"
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm Double Tap in 2k17 (Bap)
The difference is this machine got a long arse magazine (Grr, grr)
I know you see this hunting knife that's poking through my jeans (Yeah, yeah)
We had London screaming T******, they don't care 'bout what it, care 'bout what it—
I feel like I'm Double Tap in 2k17 (Bap, bap)
The difference is this machine got a long arse magazine (Grr, grr, grr)
I know you see this hunting knife that's poking through my jeans (Yeah, yeah)
We had London screaming T******, they don't care 'bout what it means (Yo, hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Yo
I ain't done one show, mans high risk (No)
I ain't goin' Wireless fireless (No)
I just pray I get through with this .19
I ain't thinkin' 'bout no COVID virus
Mask on BHA, press on the nine
Fuck killin' them with kindness (Yeah)
It was ****, but now one of them's minus
Fire still walks on their block in sliders (Real)
They keep sayin' we're wet
Come test the waters and find it out (Yeah)
He didn't mind his mouth
So, they guys got mad and they slimed him out (Brr)
Whoever's the king better hide that crown
If I swing my ching, I'ma knife that down
Tell my **** get stuck and I lie that down
If he still talks crud, I'ma slide back 'round (Skrrt)
Gamble your life, blud, bet it (Bet it)
Roll the dice and see if man tek it (Tek it)
Load the nine with bine and selek it ('lek it)
Aim the wap at his wig and press it, press it
Stepped in the room, clocked two scrum
I instantly backed my dick out (Woo)
I pray that she got a big mouth
Yo, gyal, both of you two take your tits out
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm Double Tap in 2k17 (Bap)
The difference is this machine got a long arse magazine (Grr, grr)
I know you see this hunting knife that's poking through my jeans (Yeah, yeah)
We had London screaming T******, they don't care 'bout what it, care 'bout what it—
I feel like I'm Double Tap in 2k17 (Bap, bap)
The difference is this machine got a long arse magazine (Grr, grr, grr)
I know you see this hunting knife that's poking through my jeans (Yeah, yeah)
We had London screaming T******, they don't care 'bout what it means (Yo, hahaha)

[Verse 3]
It don't make no sense why R***** tried to hop the fence (Nah)
F**** don't like us 'cause we borred up all his friends
They must think I'm cheeky if I can't go back to the ends
But when my license finish, I'ma circle 'round them, circle 'round them

[Outro]
Ay
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Hahaha
