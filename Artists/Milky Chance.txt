Song title: Stolen Dance

[Verse 1]
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

[Chorus]
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
[Verse 2]
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

[Chorus]
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it190EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Cocoon

[Intro]
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh

[Verse 1]
I know that you must feel like facing
With ruin, facing with ruin
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened
When I'm weakened

[Chorus]
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Instead of you
[Verse 2]
I've been always playing
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating
Overestimated
I made it really hard for you
Hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping

[Chorus]
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Instead of you

[Refrain]
Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah
[Chorus]
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, now I will bleed
Instead of you22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm tired of all this talking
'Cause everything you hear is empty words
But who am I, oh to say this
'Cause everything you hear is just words, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

So what's the point, of going somewhere
When everyone you see, is just nothing but confused

You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

Song title: Down By The River

[Chorus]
Down by the river
I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion
And to the lovers place
I was stucked in a puddle
Full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
That we've paid unlike

Honey, I know hey

I felt like we can throw away
The falseness of our past
And I know too
It's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do

Song title: Flashed Junk Mind

[Bridge]
When we were young souls
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine
I feel your heartbeat
All the time

[Chorus]
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day

[Bridge]
And we were young souls
On the junk-yard
Now we are stunned minds
Full of junk-goods
But I feel your heartbeat
Just like mine
I feel your heartbeat
All the time
[Chorus]
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day
And we were bound to the city life
Flashlights when we're falling into the night
Focused on what you feel
Just when you were calling her love that day35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Song ohne Namen (Unknown Song)

Through the years I have learned
Try to conquering my world
I´m sitting on a fortune
And falling in love

Love´s the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my blood seems obviously
E-oh a haunting melody

I try to forget
You know memories
I´m still on the run
I´m begging on my knees

Will I ever learn
How to catch control?
Will I ever know?
You go into my soul

OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
Your friends are gotta know
Your fucked up by yourself
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
They leave you all alone
And now you´re on your own
Through the years I have learned
Try to conquering my world
I´m sitting on a fortune
And falling in love

Love´s the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my blood seems obviously
E-oh a haunting melody

I try to forget
You know memories
I´m still on the run
I´m begging on my knees

Will I ever learn
How to catch control?
Will I ever know?
You go into my soul

OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
Your friends are gotta know
Your fucked up by yourself
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
They leave you all alone
And now you´re on your own7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Firebird

[Verse 1]
There may be some but none like you
We'll be understood 'cause you're the truth
Give me a few more off to do
Call is conquering the love for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open so I
Can see if there's a rain drop falling away
But if your words get suddenly blurred
You 'member that the truth is always worth, seeing

[Chorus]
You're like a firebird in the sky
Shining for a challenger in the night
Just like a firebird, is your heart
Keeps me warm and anchory in the stars
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird

[Verse 2]
Courageous wings make things go far
Lingering solitude can rip them off
So let the wind cross your ash thoughts
Giving you the strength to carry on
[Pre-Chorus]
I keep my eyes wide open so I
Can see if there's a rain drop falling away
But if your words get suddenly blurred
You 'member that the truth is always worth, seeing

[Chorus]
You're like a firebird in the sky
Shining for a challenger in the night
Just like a firebird, is your heart
Keeps me warm and anchory in the stars
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird
You're like a firebird

Song title: Ego

[Intro]
Ego,  see your ego
Ego,  see your ego, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
And I'm missing my miss of roses
Holding my head high up and
My head high up and
I know that she is stronger
Cause she can break the silence, break the silence
So meet me by sea, you see it's ours
And our place to be somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away
Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away

[Chorus]
Ego, see your ego
Ego,  see your ego
Ego,  see your ego
Ego,  see your ego
[Verse 2]
When I'm seeing my miss of roses
The world is turning slower
Turning slower
And I guess that she's the strongest
That I have ever seen yet
Ever seen yet
And all along the way she'll need our love
Got to take care of her now
Care of her now
So meet us by the sea, you see it's ours
And our place to be somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away
Gold shimmering sand is making me thinking of her
Thinking of her
But I am at Half Moon Bay
It's just too far away
Just too far away

[Chorus]
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Just too far away
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego
Just too far away
Ego, see your ego
Ego, see your ego4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: The Game

[Verse 1]
I'm about to lose the allusion my heart
Pictures that I thought that could faint
Colours I’ve just come along getting blurred
Like it ain't never gonna be the same
And I know that I've messed up with the chances I got
All I do is try to make it right
All I do is try to make it right
Guess I’ll do this all my life

[Chorus]
Nothing ever seems to be easy
All I do is stand in the rain
I don't really know how to get there
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game
Everybody says that I'm dreaming
But I'm just tryna cope with the pain
I don't really care for the rumours
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna play (Wanna play), wanna play (Play)
But I don't know ’bout the rules of the game
Wanna play (Wanna play), wanna play (Play)
But I don’t know 'bout the rules of the game
[Verse 2]
Images of colour giving peace to my heart
Taking all the doubts from my mind
Catch your body echo of the words I’ve said—"Please"
To let me keep up with the time
And I hope there'll be any other chances I get
And I hope I can take them with the mood that I have
Anything can make me get in close, but instead
Everything is pushing me away

[Chorus]
Nothing ever seems to be easy
All I do is stand in the rain
I don't really know how to get there
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game
Everybody says that I’m dreaming
But I'm just tryna cope with the pain
I don't really care for the rumours
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna play (Wanna play), wanna play (Play)
But I don't know 'bout the rules of the game
Wanna play (Wanna play), wanna play (Play)
But I don't know 'bout the rules, don't know 'bout the rules of the game
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Nothing ever seems to be easy
All I do is stand in the rain
I don't really know how to get there
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game
Everybody says that I'm dreaming
But I'm just tryna cope with the pain
I don't really care for the rumours
Just tell me 'bout the rules of the game

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna play (Wanna play), wanna play (Play)
But I don't know 'bout the rules of the game
Wanna play (Wanna play), wanna play (Play)
But I don't know 'bout the rules, don't know 'bout the rules of the game
But I don't know 'bout the rules, don't know 'bout the rules of the game1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
