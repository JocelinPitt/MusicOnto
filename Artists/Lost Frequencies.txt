Song title: Reality

[Chorus]
Decisions as I go to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational
I can fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow I don't know
Decisions as I go to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational
I can fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow I don't know

[Verse]
Stop claiming what you own, don't think about the show
We're all playing the same game, waiting on our loan
We're unknown and known, special and a clone
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow

[Chorus]
Make me feel the warmth, make me feel the cold
It's written in our stories, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancing in the moonlight, don't we have it all?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Decisions as I go to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational
I can fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow I don't know
Make me feel the warmth, make me feel the cold
It's written in our stories, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancing in the moonlight, don't we have it all?37EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1]
Hey melody
Every night you play me something sweet
And when I'm down, you always change the key
I need you now, my heart has lost the beat
And I'm counting on your love, hey melody
We both could use a reason just to smile
So let me be your harmony tonight
Every note you hit cuts into me

So let me hear your love, sing
So let me hear your love, sing
Let me hear your love, sing
So let me hear your love, sing
So let me hear your love, sing
Let me hear your love, sing

[Verse 2]
Hey melody
Every night you play me something sweet
And when I'm down, you always change the key
I need you now, my heart has lost the beat
And I'm counting on your love, hey melody
We both could use a reason just to smile
So let me be your harmony tonight
Every note you hit cuts into me
[Chorus]
So let me hear your love, sing
So let me hear your love, sing
Let me hear your love, sing
So let me hear your love, sing
So let me hear your love, sing
Let me hear your love, sing7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Are You with Me

[Chorus]
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?

[Bridge]
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

[Interlude]
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?

[Chorus]
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me?, are you with me?

Are you with me?
I wanna dance by water 'neath the Mexican sky
Drink some Margaritas by a string of blue lights
Listen to the Mariachi play at midnight
Are you with me, are you with me?

Song title: Like I Love You

[Verse 1]
Oh it's a long way down
But if you don’t look, you don't have to know it
And I can be around
To catch your fall if you're losing your grip

[Pre-Chorus]
Can’t you see that I come crawling on my knees
To get to you, get to you, get to you
Can't you see that I climb mountains just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you

[Chorus]
But do you love me like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way that anybody else could love you
Like I love you

[Post-Chorus]
Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you

[Verse 2]
Know you've been hurt before (fore, fore)
But a little love is enough to save ya
Yeah, we could take our time for sure
'Cause something real is worth the waiting
[Pre-Chorus]
Can’t you see that I come crawling on my knees
To get to you, get to you, get to you
Can’t you see I swim the ocean just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you

[Chorus]
But do you love me like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don’t want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way that anybody else could love you
Like I love you

[Post-Chorus]
Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you

[Bridge]
I know you wanted me but
You won't surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
I know you wanted me but
She won’t surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
In the dark
[Chorus]
Do you love me like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way that anybody else could love you
Like I love you

[Post-Chorus]
Like I love you (nobody else could)
Love you (nobody else could)
Like I love you
Love you

Anywhere you are and you'll go, I follow
Mountain high and river low, I follow

Beautiful, beautiful life

Song title: All or Nothing

[Verse 1]
All or nothing
You know what you're doing, but the clock is ticking
Give it your best and then you're onto something
And keeps on getting closer, closer
All or nothing
Everything's silent and your head just sweating
Something not sure except the way you're heading
You know it's getting closer, closer

[Chorus]
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say "all in", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing

[Verse 2]
All or nothing
Take a step forward and you know she's looking
Take a deep breath before you make it happen
Keeps on getting closer, closer

[Chorus]
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say "all in", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing
All or nothing
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say "all in", you don't get to choose again
All or nothing
If you go all in, you got a lot to lose, my friend
All or nothing
If you say "all in", you don't get to choose again
All or nothingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Send Her My Love

[Intro]
Send her my love
Send her my love

[Verse]
Here's a note
Can you give it to the one my heart belonged to
Many years ago, years ago
Big mistake, didn't say "I'm sorry"
Now the one that I need is a million miles away, miles away

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel that sorrow to the deepest core
Tried to escape but I drink it more
This fire inside 'bout to burn me down, oh

[Chorus]
And if you find
The one that's mine
Please send her my love? (send her my love)
Send her my love (send her my love)
And if you find
Her heart in time
Please send her my love (send her my love)
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
[Verse 2]
On the road I was caught up running wild
I didn't tell her how much I love her so, I hurt her soul
Not long ago, we had something in common
But the winds kept blowing and changed us both
That's all she wrote

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel that sorrow to the deepest core
Tried to escape but I drink it more
The fire inside 'bout to burn me down, oh
One last chance gonna stop these tears
Prolly come around for too many years
I'll do anything just to make it clear, oh

[Chorus]
And if you find
The one that's mine
Please send her my love (send her my love)
Send her my love (send her my love)
And if you find
Her heart in time
Please send her my love (send her my love)
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
Send her my love
[Bridge]
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh

Song title: In Too Deep

[Verse 1]
Your dreams, they're on my back
Your dreams are in my head
Your hands are on my skin
I know where we're going
I know where we're going

[Chorus]
I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
And I will do my best to go
If we get in too deep
But right now I'm gonna let this slide
You'll be mine, mine, mine
You'll be mine
And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm falling down
From heaven to the ground
I know we'll get another round
You know what we're doing
You know what we're doing, babe

[Chorus]
I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
And I will do my best to go
If we get in too deep
But right now I'm gonna let this slide
You'll be mine, mine, mine
You'll be mine
And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
[Bridge]
And I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep

[Chorus]
I will try to let you go
If we get in too deep
And I will do my best to go

Song title: Rise

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
It's been a hard year, feelin' the weight now
All of the hurt, all of the dirt, all of the shame now
Nothin' but closed doors, not gonna break down
(I rise)
See, doubt is a strong drug, it gets in your bloodstream
You lose your hope, you lose your soul, you lose the whole thing
And I fought my whole life to know it won't break me
(I rise)

[Chorus]
Ain't no way, no way I'm stoppin' now
Gonna make my way right through the clouds
I rise
I rise
I'ma grit my teeth and bear the pain
Gonna climb this mountain once again
I rise
I rise

[Pre-Drop]
I rise
I rise
[Drop]
I rise
I rise

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' stronger, stronger than I've been
I weather the storm, weather the rain, I am the lightnin' (Lightnin')
Don't need a shelter, I'm done with the hidin'
(I rise)

[Chorus]
Ain't no way, no way I'm stoppin' now
Gonna make my way right through the clouds
I rise
I rise
I'ma grit my teeth and bear the pain
Gonna climb this mountain once again
I rise
I rise

[Pre-Drop]
I rise
I rise

[Drop]
I rise
