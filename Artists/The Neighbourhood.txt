Song title: Sweater Weather

[Verse 1]
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
Now, let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[Outro]
And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater484EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Daddy Issues

[Verse 1]
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

[Verse 2]
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

[Bridge]
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
[Refrain]
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

[Outro]
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too124EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Daddy Issues (Remix)

[Verse 1: Syd]
Take me to your place (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's skip the foreplay (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Syd]
Hey, you ask me what I’m thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about us (Us)
And this is how the story begins
I'll never tell this story again
’Til one of us is making amends

[Chorus: Syd & Jesse Rutherford]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
Daddy stuck around but he wasn't present
Cheated on your mom but she never left him
First I didn't get it, now I understand
He broke her heart, left money in her hands
So everything got paid for
She made sure you and your brother had way more
Than she ever had growing up (Yeah)
But when you told me the whole story, I felt like throwing up
I could see it on your face, it was rough
Left a bad taste on your tongue
And she didn't even take any drugs
She would rain all day, couldn't wait for her sun to shine
And you made it shine
There when she cried, you saved her life
[Chorus: Syd & Jesse Rutherford]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I’d run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)
And if you were my little girl
I’d do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)

[Outro: Syd & Jesse Rutherford]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues (And I do too)10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: R.I.P. 2 My Youth

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth
And you can play this at my funeral
Wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin
Might go to hell and there ain't no stopping
Might be a sinner and I might be a saint
I'd like to be proud but somehow I'm ashamed
Sweet little baby in a world full of pain
I gotta be honest, I don't know if I could take it
Everybody's talkin' but what's anybody saying?
Mama said if I really want it, then I can change it, yeah
R.I.P. to my youth
If you really listen, then this is to you
Mama, there is only so much I can do
Tough for you to witness but it was for me too

[Chorus]
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me (In front of me)

[Verse 2]
R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth, yeah
You can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars
Throw me in a box with the oxygen off
You gave me the key and you locked every lock
When I can't breathe, I won't ask you to stop
When I can't breathe, don't call for a cop
I was naive and hopeful and lost
Now I'm aware and driving my thoughts, woah
[Bridge]
What do I do? What do I do?
I don't believe it if I don't keep proof
I don't believe it if I don't know you
I don't believe it if it's on the news or on the Internet
I need a cigarette

[Chorus]
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me
I'm using white lighters to see

[Verse 3]
R.I.P. to my youth
And you could call this the funeral
I'm just telling the truth
And you can play this at my funeral
Tell my sister don't cry and don't be sad
I'm in paradise with Dad
Close my eyes and then cross my arms
Put me in the dirt, let me be with the stars

[Outro]
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me
I'm using white lighters to see what's in front of me84EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Afraid

[Intro]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place

[Verse 1]
Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)
[Verse 2]
Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
Oh, if they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it
And I can't even see if it’s out there anymore, so

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Bridge]
Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me, then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience
Calms me down, lets me face this, let me sleep
And when I wake up, let me be
[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me

Song title: The Beach

[Verse 1]
If I told you that I loved you
Tell me, what would you say?
If I told you that I hated you
Would you go away?
Now I need your help with everything that I do
I don't want to lie, I've been relying on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Fallin' again
I need a pick-me-up
I've been callin' you "friend,"
I might need to give it up

[Chorus]
I'm sick, and I'm tired too
I can admit, I am not fireproof
I feel it burning me
I feel it burning you
I hope I don't murder me
I hope I don't burden you
If I do, If I do

[Verse 2]
If I meet you in the middle maybe we could agree
You make me feel little how you're looking at me
And you can throw me shade, all it does is just cool me off
First it just threw me off, now I'm just moving on
[Pre-Chorus]
Fallin' again
I need a pick-me-up
I've been callin' you "friend"
I might need to give it up

[Chorus]
I'm sick, and I'm tired too
I can admit, I am not fireproof
I feel it burning me
I feel it burning you
I hope I don't murder me
I hope I don't burden you

[Bridge]
Swim with me
I think I could see the beach
I know what's underneath
I need you here with me
But we're out in the open
Swim with me
I think I could see the beach
Just don't look underneath us
I need you here with me but we're out in the open

[Chorus]
I'm sick, and I'm tired too
I can admit, I am not fireproof
I feel it burning me
I feel it burning you
I hope I don't murder me
I hope I don't burden you
If I do, If I do55EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Cry Baby

[Verse 1]
I think I talk too much
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen, baby
I need to listen good
I think I try too hard
How I look, what I do, what I'm saying
I spend too much time explaining myself
I hope there's some time to change it

[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
But you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Verse 2]
I think I worry a lot
I need to take it easy
I got this anxious feeling
But it goes away for a minute
When I'm with you breathing
[Pre-Chorus]
I can taste it, my heart's breakin', please don't say
But you know, when you know
I can't take it, I'm impatient, tell me, baby
Now I know, you should go

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

[Bridge]
The sun's coming out but I'm feeling colder
I can't wait 'til the drought is over

[Chorus]
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's just what I'll do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby
I know I'll fall in love with you, baby
And that's not what I wanna do
I hope you won't ever lie to me
And if you do, I know I won't be your cry baby

We need to cry

Song title: Single

[Verse 1]
I don't know if we should be alone together
I still got a crush, that's obvious
If nobody's around, what's stopping us?
Everywhere I go you show whatever
I don't ever mind sharing oxygen
I just wanna get lost in your lungs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast
And I'm allergic to the waiting
She's just a baby girl
And I love to watch her dance
But it's making me go crazy

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

[Verse 2]
I don't think that we should be around each other
When you're in the room, you get my eyes
You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized
I can make you laugh until you cry
You know you got all my attention
You know you got all mine
[Pre-Chorus 2]
"Baby," I can't help but call her that
Even though I shouldn't say it
She was my baby girl
Might never get her back
But I don't mind being patient, yeah

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

[Breakdown]
I should've said that I
I should've said that I loved you
I should've said that I want her
I should've said that I
Yeah, should've said it
I should've said that I loved you, baby
Now I've lost her
Yeah, should've said that I
Don't know why, mhm

[Bridge]
Okay, I'm just gonna tell you what I gotta say right here
I'm sorry Dave, I never meant to hurt your baby girl
She's your little baby, she's my soulmate
I don't want you to worry, she'll be so safe right here
Oh, so, Dave, would you let your baby be my girl?

Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

Song title: Prey

[Verse 1]
As long as you notice
I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
If you don't ask, I won't tell
Just know that, just know that
It all hurts, it all hurts just the same

[Chorus 1]
Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know what they might do if they catch you too early
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

[Verse 2]
As long as you notice
I'm hoping that you'll keep your heart open
I'll keep mine open too
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind
But you, you'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're alright

[Chorus 1]
Something is wrong, I can't explain
Everything changed when the birds came
You'll never know what they might do if they catch you too early
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying
[Bridge]
(If I run) If I run away I'll never know
(What you want)
And if you go then I’ll never grow
(I'm undone)
Let me slip, let me slide
(If you run) I'll be sure to let you fly

[Chorus 2]
Something is off, I can't explain
You know what I mean, don't you?
Something I saw, or something I did that made me like this
Could you help me?
We need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying
Something is off, I feel like prey, I feel like praying

[Verse 3]
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind
But you, you'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're alright
So, so, I'll probably take you aside
And tell you what's on my mind
But you, you'll just keep it inside
Probably tell me that you're alright

Song title: Scary Love

[Verse 1]
Move to the city with me
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone
You're too pretty for me
Baby, I know, it's true, yeah
You look better when you first wake up
Than anybody else I've fucked
Baby, I got good luck with you

Ooo, yeah, I need you here, oh
Your love is scaring me
No one has ever cared for me

Ooo, yeah, I need you here

[Verse 2]
Drivin' through the city with me
Just watching you glow
I'm in the passenger seat, you're in control
It's on you now, mhm
You look better every day, I swear
Really, it's a little unfair
Baby, I'm star-struck by you

Didn't know we'd get so far
And it's only the start

Maybe it wasn't meant to be
If we fall apart
Then it was our favorite dream
Ooo, ooo, ehh

Your love is therapy
No drug can give me clarity
As much as you do (As you do, babe)
Ooo, yeah, I need you here (I need you here)
