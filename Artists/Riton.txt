Song title: Rinse & Repeat

[Chorus: Kah-Lo]
Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

[Chorus: Kah-Lo]
Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

And it just goes on

[Chorus: Kah-Lo & Riton]
Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on
(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)

[Verse: Kah-Lo & Riton]
Got to turn it way up
It's time to get down
So loud that my ears pop
We can't turn back now
What is a turn-down?
To the club we go
So what? The song comes up
And it just goes on

(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

[Chorus: Kah-Lo]
Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on
[Chorus: Kah-Lo]
Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on

[Chorus: Kah-Lo & Riton]
Time to make the club go up
Time to shut the club down
This is not how I woke up
But it's how I look now
If you leave with me
We'll be on till morn
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on


(And it just goes on)
(And it just goes on)
Then we rinse and repeat
And it just goes on
Time to make the club go up4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Money

[Verse 1: Mr Eazi]
Everybody wants money, money
To live in a location sunny, sunny
But that life ain't funny for me, for me
Cause I don't need that much money, money
See the thing about money, money
Soon as you get it everybody wants it
But that life just ain't for me
Cause the best things in life are free (alo, alo)
Everybody wants money, money
To live in a location sunny, sunny
But that life ain't funny for me, for me
Cause I don't need that much money, money
See the thing about money, money
Soon as you get it everybody wants it
But that life just ain't for me
Cause the best things in life are free (alo, alo)

[Pre-Chorus: Kah-Lo]
I need that money, money
So I can keep myself fleeky, fleeky
If I want it, I got it
So trips to Capri is nothing, nothing
See the thing about money, money
Is I'm a fly girl who needs everything
But you keep on telling me
That the best things in life are free
I don't agree
[Chorus: All]
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go

[Verse 2: Davido]
You be acting funny (no way)
When there is no money (no way)
Thought you were my honey (no way)
Really thought you loved me 'yar (no mula, no love)
But you want my money
Baby, shake your body
I will give you money
I will make you happier

[Pre-Chorus: Kah-Lo]
I need that money, money
So I can keep myself fleeky, fleeky
If I want it, I got it
So trips to Capri is nothing, nothing
See the thing about money, money
Is I'm a fly girl who needs everything
But you keep on telling me
That the best things in life are free
I don't agree
[Chorus: All]
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go

Song title: Lost My Mind

[Bridge: Scrufizzer]
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain

[Hook: Jay Norton]
Oh, I, I don't know
Where I lost my mind, but it's gone
You are so wrong
You don't deserve the shit that I put you on

[Verse: Scrufizzer]
Suddenly a lot of fellas wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna bad up
Any bruddas better see me, like these fellas wanna chat up
You fool, you better start stepping aside
Deading your hype if I come with the metal, I ride
I ain't telling 'em twice, you better remind your man
Just jump back [?]
You didn't wanna care, now I'm here, you wanna stare
It's clear, you're a mess, now I'm here, I'm so aware
That you don't respect me like you did
I'm kind of pissed how money changed you, see, life's a bitch
I can see all the jealousy around you
[?] like that sound to you
Can I say that I took your style?
Don't make sense when you ain't been in style
[Hook: Jay Norton]
Oh, I, I don't know
Where I lost my mind, but it's gone
You are so wrong
You don't deserve the shit that I put you on

[Bridge: Scrufizzer]
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain

[Bridge: Scrufizzer]
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
Talking like they're badder, how they really wanna complain
Round here in the manor, chatting, saying how they want me
