Song title: Silence

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

[Verse 2]
I'm in need of a savior (Savior), but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence
[Chorus]
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long

[Drop]
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long116EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse]
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you
I'm so alone, nothing feels like home
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I'm so alone, trying to find my way back home to you

I'm so alone, nothing feels like home

Song title: Keep It Mello

[Verse 1]
Woke up and just felt right
Phone blown like a tailpipe
Today's schedule airtight
I turn a short day into a long night
See you soon if you got the heart
Meet you outside Rennie Park
Hurry up if it's gettin' dark
We don't say much and that says a lot
Hopped into that old Benz
Drive through where that road ends
Good times with some old friends
I got just the thing if you so tense
Burn one, let's go do some
She got me stoned as Medusa
Zoned out with a blank stare
I'm lookin' into the future

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
It's good to finally let go
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just like to keep it mello
[Chorus]
Yeah I like to keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello

[Verse 2]
It's like 4 am and I'm bored again
When that 40 end
When that dream team all played out and they hit the bench
I just step back, lemme soak it in
I've seen the ups and downs so I get it now, I was born to win
It's my time, 'bout time, my turn, I can't lie
Waiting for that one spark
My one hope to catch fire
I'm fine, I'm high
Light rain through that sunshine
Tryin' to man this old boat
I'm the captain now and it's crunch time
I don't care if I'm gettin' paid
Need the week but I get the day
Wide awake when I need sleep
I'm knee deep but I set the way
Focused on that one mistake, let it free don't let it break
Fuck it all, I'm turning in
My celly's off, the great escape
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up, ain't nothing gonna hold us
Put the devil to the side
Got an angel on my shoulder
And I'm like hello
It's good to finally let go
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just like to keep it mellow

[Chorus]
Yeah I like to keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello

[Chorus]
Yeah I like to keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
[Outro]
I smoke to keep it mello
I drink to keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello
Every day I keep it mello9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Here With Me

[Verse 1]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
And I need you here with me
When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
'Cause I need you here with me

[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Verse 2]
I think I see your face in every place that I go
I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
'Cause I need you here with me
[Chorus]
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me
Every day
You're saying the words that I want you to say
There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
Now I know I'm falling in deep
'Cause I need you here with me

[Outro]
Can I tell you something just between you and me?
When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
Every single word is perfect as it can be
'Cause I need you here with me26EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Ritual

[Verse 1: Wrabel]
You, you're givin' me life
Givin' me all of you, mmm
Oh, it's true
Losin' myself, I found me right next you, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Wrabel]
You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making this thing look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, oh yeah

[Chorus: Wrabel]
Whoa oh, I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa oh, I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
My holy ground
Praying it's all true, now that I've found you
It's my ritual

[Post-Chorus - Instrumental: Wrabel]
(It's my ritual)
(Now that I've found you)
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
My holy ground
Praying it's all true, now that I've found you
My ritual
[Verse 2: Wrabel]
You, first thing on my mind when I'm waking up is you, oh yeah
When I'm blue, you spin me around the color wheel
Yes, you do, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Wrabel]
You're something different
Instead of breaking my heart, you're picking up all the pieces
The way you're taking my heart
You're making this thing look easy
But when I'm stuck in my head
We stay in bed through the weekend, oh yeah

[Chorus: Wrabel]
Whoa oh, I never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa oh, I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
So hold me down
Don't know what I'd do if I was without you
My holy ground
Praying it's all true, now that I've found you
It's my ritual

[Post-Chorus: Wrabel]
(Now that I've found you)
Never knew love, never knew love, never knew love
Living without you, living without you
Whoa oh, I, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost, I don't feel lost
Now that I've found you, now that I've found you
(It's my ritual)
[Outro: Wrabel]
Say you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm lost without my ritual14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
