Song title: Black Magic

Driving down the four-five
Running all the stop signs
The way you're touching my skin
The way you're making me sin
Laying in your back seat
So put your magic on me
Come on tie me up in your strings (uh)
Make me do anything
Yeah, yeah, got me looking hella crazy
Yeah, yeah, got me tripping on you lately
Yeah, yeah, I'm under your spell and I'm under your body
Oh-ohh
It's like black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me, yeah
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me, yeah
Black, black magic, oh just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black
Black, black (on me)
Black (oh, just like that)
Black black (on me)
Black black
Staring in your dark eyes
You're controlling my mind
The way you're touching my skin
The way you're making me sin
Praying down on my knees
So the devil doesn't take me
Tangled up in emotions
We go down in slow motion
Yeah, yeah, got me looking hella crazy
Yeah, yeah, got me tripping on you lately
Yeah, yeah, I'm under your spell and I'm under your body
Oh-ohh
It's like black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me, yeah
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic, the things you do to me yeah
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magic, you work your voodoo on me
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black (black, black magic)
Black, black (on me)
Black, black
Black, black magic
Black, black magic
Black, black magic, oh, just like that
Black, black magicEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Zombie

[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Hook]
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying

[Chorus]
In your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e
What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e-e

[Verse 2]
Another mother's breaking heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
[Hook]
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying

[Chorus]
In your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e
What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-e-e-eEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Wannabe

[Verse 1]
If you want my future, forget my past
If  you wanna get with me, better make it fast
Now  don't go wasting my precious time, no
Get your act together we could be just fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
What  I want, want, want, yeah
So  tell me what you want, what you really, really want

[Chorus]
So if you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make  it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy but that's the way it is (Zig-a-zig-ah)

[Verse 2]
Oh, what do you think about that, now you know how I feel
Say,  you can handle my love, are you for real?
No, I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try, yeah
If you really really bug me then I'll say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
What I want, want, want, yeah
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
[Chorus]
So if you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy but that's the way it is (Zig-a-zig-ah)

[Bridge]
So here's a story from A to Z
You wanna get with me, you better listen carefully
We got Em in the place who likes it in your face
We got G like MC who likes it on a
Easy V doesn't come for free, she's a real lady
And as for me, ha, you'll see
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and- (Zig-a-zig-ah)

[Chorus]
If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy but that's the way it is (Zig-a-zig-ah)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Let It Be Me

(VERSE 1)
Try to escape
While we still have time
What is yours and mine
We are beyond that line

(PRE)
We're wide awake
Let's getaway
Before the lights come on
It's not too late
Steal their champagne
It's time to make a run

(CHORUS)
We can turn this night to something beautiful
We're the best when we dare to be unusual
If you need someone in your wildest dreams
Let it be me
Let it be me

(VERSE 2)
It's what they say
Only the brave die young
But if, if we stay
We'll fade out like a song
(PRE)
We're wide awake
Let's make mistakes
It's time to chase the sun
We're not too late
Tomorrow waits
It's time to make a run

(CHORUS)
We can turn this night to something beautiful
We're the best when we dare to be unusual
If you need someone in your wildest dreams
Let it be me
Let it be meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
