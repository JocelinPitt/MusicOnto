Song title: Havana

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Hey

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Ayy)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (Uh-huh)
Havana, ooh na-na (Uh)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (Uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (Uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (Hey)
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (Uh)
He got me feelin' like...

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ayy)
I knew it when I met him (Ayy), I loved him when I left him

And then I had to tell him, I had to go
Oh na-na-na-na-na (Woo)
[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, hey)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy, uh-huh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)
My heart is in Havana (Ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na
[Verse 2: Young Thug]
(Jeffery)
Just graduated, fresh on campus, mmm
Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn (Fresh out East Atlanta)
Bump on her bumper like a traffic jam
Hey, I was quick to pay that girl like Uncle Sam (Here you go, ayy)
Back it on me (Back it up)
Shawty cravin' on me, get to eatin' on me (On me)
She waited on me (And what?)
Shawty cakin' on me, got the bacon on me (Wait up)
This is history in the makin', homie (Homie)
Point blank, close range, that B (Tah, tah)
If it cost a million, that's me (That's me)
I was gettin' mula, baby

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Pharrell Williams]
Havana, ooh na-na (Ayy, ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh na-na (Oh, ayy, ayy, uh-huh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (Oh, no)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (Huh)
My heart is in Havana (Ayy)
Havana, ooh na-na

Song title: Never Be the Same

[Verse 1]
Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
[Verse 2]
Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
[Bridge]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

[Chorus]
I'm sayin' it's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (You're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same (I'll never be the...)
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same199EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Crying in the Club

[Verse 1]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
[Verse 2]
You may think that you'll die without her
But you know, that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up
Like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body
Like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
[Bridge]
You think that you'll die without him
You know, that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true
I said ain't no... (Ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
I said ain't no... (Ain't no...)
Ain't no crying...
Ain't no crying in the club, no crying...
Whoa

[Chorus]
Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey
Let the beat carry away, your tears as they fall, baby
Ain't no crying in the club, hey, hey
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club (I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more)
I won't, I won't, I...
Ain't no crying in the club (I won't cry, I won't cry, I won't cry no more)

Song title: Real Friends

[Verse 1]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fine's"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do I even try?
Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides?
Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town (oh, ooh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I stay up, talkin' to the moon (ooh)
Been feelin' so alone in every crowded room
Can't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah
'Cause the place I'm livin' in
Just doesn't feel like home

[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Wonder where they're all hidin' out
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Lookin' for some real friends
Oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something
Spell the names of all the dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me, what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again?
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?
[Chorus]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
Then, I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh (ah)
Oh, yeah, ah115EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: My Oh My

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Oh)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & DaBaby]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (Let's go, so am I)

[Verse 2: DaBaby & Camila Cabello]
Look, I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy (Oh yeah)
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even (Yeah, yeah)
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hot
[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
My, my, my, my, my oh my
My mama doesn't trust you, baby
My, my, my, my, my oh my
And my daddy doesn't know you, no

My, my, my, my, my oh my (My, my, my, ooh)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)

My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)

Song title: Shameless

[Verse 1]
Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run (Oh), no, don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
[Verse 2]
So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

[Post-Chorus]
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
No-oh, uh-uh, don't wanna do this now
[Bridge]
Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in, I want you to give in, oh
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

[Chorus]
Right now, I'm shameless
Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
I need you more than I want to

Song title: Consequences

[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences
[Bridge]
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

[Chorus 2]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

[Outro]
Yeah, loving you114EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: I Have Questions

[Verse 1]
Why did you leave me here to burn?
I'm way too young to be this hurt
I feel doomed in hotel rooms staring straight up at the wall
Counting wounds, and I am trying to numb them all

[Refrain]
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here

[Chorus 1]
I have questions for you
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you (I have questions)
Number three, why weren't you
Who you swore that you would be?
I have questions, I got questions haunting me
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
[Verse 2]
My, my name was safest in your mouth
And why'd you have to go and spit it out?
Oh, your voice, it was the most familiar sound
But it sounds so dangerous to me now

[Chorus 2]
I have questions for you (He-ey)
Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart
(I have questions for you)
Number two, why would you try and play me for a fool?
I should have never ever ever trusted you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you

[Refrain]
Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?
I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?
I was there, I was there, when no one was
Now you're gone, and I'm here
[Outro]
I have questions for you (ooh)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have questions for you (ooh)
I have questions for you (foul play, no, foul play, no)
I have questions for you (I have questions)
I have questions for you
I have questions for you
How do I fix it? Can we talk? Can we communicate? Can we talk? Do I wanna fix it?
I have questions for you (I'm afraid of you)
Is it my fault? Is it my fault? Do you miss me?
I have questions110EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Liar

[Verse 1]
I don't care if you're here
Or if you're not alone
I don't care, it's been too long
It's kinda like we didn't happen
The way that your lips move
The way you whisper slow
I don't care, it's good as gone (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I won't lose control, I don't want it (Ooh)
I said I won't get too close, but I can't stop it (Ooh)

Oh no, there you go, making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, there you go, you're making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go, startin' up a fire
Oh no, no (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
You're watching, I feel it (Hey)
I know I shouldn't stay (Yeah, yeah)
I picture your hands on me (I think I wanna let it happen)
But what if you kiss me? (Yeah)
And what if I like it?
And no one sees it
[Pre-Chorus]
I said I won't lose control, I don't want it (Ooh)
I said I won't get too close, but I can't stop it (No, ooh)
