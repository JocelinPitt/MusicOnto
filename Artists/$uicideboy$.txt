Song title: Kill Yourself (Part III)

[Intro: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all
[Bridge: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
'Til the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit, thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch

[Outro: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might321EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Intro: $lick $loth]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: $lick $loth]
Tell me what you know 'bout a motherfucker out the bottom
With a gold grill gleamin', makin' all these hoes problems
Stalker, creepin' out the fuckin' dungeon
Switchblade on 'em, hit the guts like a pumpkin, dumpin'
Thirty rounds of the clip, off rip
Too thick with the stick, bet I won't miss
Lil $lick real sick, don't talk shit
Whip, whip, like a brick scale on fish
$uicide, night time, no, we don't fight crime, oh
It's the Grey*59 with the real red eyes, and we dying inside, ooh
Bodies in fluoride, let the rope untie, just crucify me
Yung Christ wrists sliced, couple hoes on ice, singing, "R.I.P."

[Verse 2: Ruby da Cherry]
Ruby was a motherfucking reject
Then I cut my wrists, and now I motherfucking bleed checks
Still broke after all the motherfucking weed gets rolled
Hoes askin' if I see a ghost
Tell 'em, "No, I just seep smoke when the weed's blown"
She chokes from the deep-throat, three feet of rope, lethal
Slay the fuckin' sheep, so evil, I'ma hang myself
And then I get to see home, Ruby a fucking demon (Ayy, uh)
Ruby got a cult now, hoes tryna bolt down
Ruby the result of a reject from a small town
Turned into a demon, I'm evolved now
Loud growl, $now Leopard on the prowl, ayy
Stay the fuck back, ho, slay the whole pack, ho
Paint the globe black, ho (Ayy)
Soon I will shed this skin, turn to the devil
Then I'll never reminisce (Ayy)

Song title: $outh $ide $uicide

[Verse 1: $lick $loth]
Outside in an all black ride, tint rolled up when I'm high
Said they all wanna live, but I just wanna die
Mo-Motherfucker, if you're looking for me, find me in the night
I got a knife, don't wanna fight
I wanna take your fucking life, and end it right on sight
When I strike, if you bark, better bite
Block hot, fuck the cops, pop a six-shot Glock
Then I trot to the rocks, with me own blood clot
Red-dot, bodies drop when I cock, then I spot
No tomb, no plot, throw 'em off of the yacht, undocked
With the slot of the skull hangin' in the fucking river, ho
$ui-$uicide, 6-6-6, *59, so cynical

[Verse 2: Yung Plague]
Got a pound in the blunt, I'm loungin'
Pour another round, I'm drownin'
Climb to the top, I will jump off the mountain, ayy
Swerv-swervin' in a motherfucking all-white Crown Vic'
Blue light mounted, siren howlin'
Stole it from a cop because he popped another brown kid (Ayy)
Got the town lit up by the flame that I made
From my grey serenade, make way for the Plague
On the seventh day, grey bodies lay in they graves
Still got the badge, still got the gun
Still got the patch, still got the stun
Still got the cash, bitch, I burn it for fun
Put the Glock to my skull then I—
[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
$outh $ide $uicide, kill yourself, ho
Say you gettin' money, but your numbers don't show, you a liar
Baseball bat fully wrapped in barbed wire
For anyone that's tryna get by us (Bitch)
I been thinkin' a lot, I see these rappers tryna get at my spot
Robb told me, "You gotta get it how you live"
Told that bitch, "You better get up out my biz"
Pickle-breath-ass ho with a face like thizz (Shut the fuck up)
You don't want no issue with
Nose seen more blow than most nose seen a tissue
I got anxiety so I can't really do a interview
Don't come close to me
I'm not the one to really do it how it's 'posed to be
Independent, tell that label to get over me
I'm over here with my peers, gettin' rich point blank
Before I bring her to the crib, make sure that bitch don't stink
Ain't no rules to the game, talk how you want (Yuh)
Walk how you want (Yuh), my job is the shit
I used to clean up shit from the rim of the toilet
Now I'm gettin' money, I don't gotta pack a pistola
Okay, maybe (Maybe)
'Cause jealousy make a man go crazy
Money make a motherfucker hate me
One thousand bitches, they all wanna date me128EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Antarctica

[Intro: Haley Gibby]
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Letting a new day begin
Hold to the time that you know

[Verse 1: YUNG $CARECROW]
Locked in my room, four black walls
Tie the noose, no recall
No resolve, fuck withdrawal
Rather shoot up till I fall
Murder on call with the *59
Twenty years, and it seem like a lifetime
I been hanging every day from a lifeline
While these fuckers had a dinner every night time
Smo-, smokin' that dope off the foil, let me ball
Ho, please don't call, don't fuck with y'all
Spray paint the walls with blood and whatever
Drag you outside, let you rot in the weather
I don't think I can explain any better
I'm $carecrow the terror and live for the lesser
My birth was an error

[Verse 2: LORD OF LONELINESS]
I am the Lord of Loneliness
I'll hold my breath, just spoke with Death
He said he hopes for the best
Told him I'm ropin' my neck
Then I woke up chokin' from the hole in my chest
Somehow I manage to function and hope
Every day got a lump in my throat
That's them pills swallowed whole
Smoke a blunt and then fuck all these hoes
End up humpin' they throat
Get the fuck away from me, I hate all of you, faithfully
This world was never made for me
Thankfully, I'm trained to see past all the lies, the ranks, the scenes
I'll shank my knees, then walk the plank and freeze

[Intro: SOULJA RAG MURDER]
Grey*59, all I see is scrubs
Face mean mugged
On a couple drugs
Smoke with Migo Plug
FTP, my blood
Grey the fucking gang
Boy, stay in your lane

[Verse 1: SOULJA RAG MURDER]
Never high, just maintain
Hate this fame, hate this game
Take these shoes, last a day
Oil flowing through my veins
Lil Remains, that make that stang
Y'all look good in cellophane, mane
Insane, real blade, swing it through your fucking brain
I said fuck 'em (fuck 'em!)
We got a problem (what?)
Fuck you gonna do with it? (huh?)
I think nada (nah)
Just a persona (fugazi), and I'm Nirvana (Cobain)
Poppin' xans to make you mad, I know you want some
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
Got an ounce of the coke, white snow flurry (what?)
River Road shawty, Yung Christ, one chosen
$lick tote the AK-47, stolen, woadie joscing
[Verse 2: SNOWMANE]
All of y'all are over-saturating 'Preme and Bape
Bitch, it's FTP all fucking day, all y'all look the fucking same
Fuck the fame, fuck a lane
Bitch, I'm 'bout to swerve into the toll booth, and scrape the change
Bring out your dead and blamin' it on Yung Plague
Bitch, I pull up with the K
K9 by my right leg 'till I say okay
Canine on his hind legs, rippin' off your face
All I gotta say is G*59 until the grave
One color, two numbers
Three fingers in the sky, amongst the thunder
I'm like, "Fuck the others"
I'ma, bring the ruckus
I might, fuck your bitch
She swears, she suffers under the covers
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma hellhound, hell-bound, shawty wanna die
I'ma sell pounds, sell pounds
Shawty said she might, let them bells pound, bells pound
Shawty wanna cry, I'm like, "Fuck it" every night
Keep turning black, I close my eyes82EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[My Flaws Burn Through My Skin Like Demonic Flames from Hell]

[Intro: Tommy Wright III]
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, gotta be equipped with a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, gotta be equipped with a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, gotta be equipped with a Jason mask

[Verse 1: YUNG MUTT]
Slumped back in the driver's seat
Blunt between my lips, I'm ridin' with a bitch that's high as me
She duckin' out, she tryna sleep
I'm duckin' out, I'm tryna see the road
But all I can see are four horsemen comin' closer to me
I think I'm about to die, we'll see
Swervin' on them motherfuckers, bitch, it ain't my time
Let the world blow up first, then I might just close my eyes
It's all I really wanted my whole life
The universe won't notice, bitch, you just another life
The sun'll rise, the stars have already died
[Chorus: Tommy Wright III]
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, gotta be equipped with a Jason mask

Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, gotta be equipped with a Jason mask
Car jack, gat packed, hard head, wig split
Die nigga, die nigga, die nigga, die, gotta be equipped with a Jason mask

[Verse 2: YUNG $CARECROW]
(I!) see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceding

[Intro: Koopsta Knicca]
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead

A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead
Dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead

[Verse 1: $WITCHBLADE $CRIM]
Eternal rest, the bloody mess
Keepin' the motherfucking devil hot
Satanic mentality, happily makin' the bodies drop
I'm on the block, circling cops
Ready for their demise
Screams resonate through the night, so I can't close my eyes
Hard to swallow when the hollows enter through your throat
Lately, I wallow in my sorrow 'cause I cannot cope
The dope, the coke, the drank, the lean
The pills, the X, the smoke
The rope to choke the pain away, I'm broken til' I croak
Ho

[Chorus: Koopsta Knicca]
Dead, a nigga dead, dead, a nigga dead, a nigga dead
A nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head, dead, a nigga dead
[Verse 2: YUNG $NOW]
Baby (Baby)
Baby, let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Baby, let me get the weed, there's more for us
When these suckers leave, yeah, we can smoke a blunt and fuck
I bust a nut, and now it's time to get the fuck up out my crib
Yeah, here's a couple bucks
Bitch, I'm Oddy Nuff, creepin' out the cut
Blood seepin' out my cut
With the shotty, 'cause you might escape the Tommy gun
Because I'm busy puffin' blunts
But soon enough you'll come back 'round
You screamin', "Lock me up—please, box me up!"
I got you, sucker
Start a flame, and turn your body into dust
Smoke your body in the blunt, copy us, I'll light it up

[Intro: Gangsta Boo]
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind

[Verse 1: ANTHONY MARS]
Walk in with a dead bitch, and a Swisher lit, drug kit
Got a half-hit worth of acid, can't quit, I'm an addict
So traumatic, and I'm manic
Feeling panicked, I need a Xanax
Pass it, as I OD real slowly
Lonely, looking ghostly
Surrounded by smoky mirror images of a fictionist, sober me
Don't give a fuck about harming me
I'm druggin' 'till I R.I.P

[Chorus: Gangsta Boo]
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind
Mask to my fuckin face I'm fiendin' to increase my high
Million blunts up in my mind, million blunts up in my mind

[Verse 2: NORMAN ATOMIC]
Take a hit of acid, been a while since I tripped
Now I'm seein' all this shit, brain glowing
Everything is bending in the same motion
Roll the blunt, I'll take a hit
Start staring at the smoke, as it twists and disappears
Peer pressure don't affect me, bitch, I take drugs on my own
Pop a perc' and snort some coke
It feel like my heart is broke because I get fucked up when I feel alone
I'm choking on this forty of OE, I'm hopin' that I don't breathe
Bitch, I'm dope, act like you know me
Shoot me up so I can OD

Uh, wake up with an ache that fades, pop two pills with Gatorade
'Round my neck hang gator fangs
Might reveal more at a later date (Hit the blunt)
But I don't know
Yung $now kind of go with the flow
Bring a ho backstage, tell her, "tell me everything you know about life"—then I bounce
Roxy hitting hard, feeling fucking sick
(Hit the blunt)
Have to smoke a half an ounce just to balance it out
Ruby backing out
Ruby blacking out
Falling fucking deeper, I think Ruby cashing out
Grass is always greener when the grave is lacking crowds
Look who's laughing now
(Hit the blunt)
An audience crackin' up, you can let the curtains down now, yuh
(Crush it up)
I wallow in sorrow, ain't no tomorrow
Missed a call from $lick, I woke up in a gown, how?
(Hit the blunt)
[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH, Gimisum Family & JGRXXN]
I just bought ten Roxy's, call up Oddy then I- (Crush it up)
Chronic laced with something, I'm like "Fuck it", let me- (Hit the blunt)
Rolling down your block, it ain't shit for the set to- (Crush it up)
Told that bitch, "Get out my ear"
She need to chill and- (Hit the blunt)
Xanax bars up in my drink, before I pour 'em (Crush it up)
We never fuck with you, fuckboy
Don't act like you can- (Hit the blunt)
Take that motherfucking bat upside your skull and- (Crush it Up)
So full of them drugs, I might throw up
I knew I shouldn't have- (Hit the blunt)

[Intro: Juicy J]
Play me some of that $uicide pimpin', man

[Verse 1: LIL CUT THROAT]
You motherfuckers pitiful, I'm too sick of you
I'm a walking visual, you boys refillable
Unforgivable, once you cross me, ho
Now you a motherfucking stain to Lil Cut Throat (pop!)
Let the guns bang
Nuts hang, drug game ain't the same
"$avage" tatted on my face
Grey ape
Blazing while we hotbox
Fuck a badge, fuck a cop, even if the K hot
Watch me bust on any block
Northside knotty
Scope on the shotty, semi blow ya body
Tony gripping on the Tommy, bitch
I bite the head off a bat like I'm Ozzy
You got a problem motherfucker? Come and try me
I'm nothing like what you punk boys wanna embody
Norf, Norf, East Side *59
Tony gripping Tommy
Fuck around end up get your body, autopsy
I be that walking zombie, bath salts
Eating bodies
Three choppa's and a shotty shooting everybody
Cigarette wet, bumpin' Boosie Badazz
On them drugs, jiggin’
Jaws locked—clinching
Trigger finger itching if you think I’m kidding
Smoke leaking from the sticky that we smoking, boy
Fuck a Backwood, Swisher's what I use, boy
Smoke what I choose, do what I wanna do
Motherfuck you and (Ruby—) your punk friends too
[Verse 2: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Ruby blunt lit, lungs itch, bitch, I like the sting
Smoking potent thinking I'm the chosen one, bitch, I'm a king
I can hear my dead homies sing
Now my eyes always hurtin', wiping tears with diamond rings, yeah, ayy
Hol' up fuckboy, who the fuck said we cool?
Man, I quit smoking with hypebeasts back in 2002
What it do? Motherfucker, I'm a fool
Ruby da Cherry is cooling with goblins
If you got a problem, then you better move
From the womb to the tomb
Busting out early, busting out soon
Blackout the city, I'm back on them 30s
In 'bout twenty minutes we'll be on the moon, uh
Drugs got me fucked up, sluts got me drugged up, fuck
Slam my face against a pill to crush it up
Government ID helps me get high
Seeing stars in the mirror like I'm looking with a bright beam
Lime green paint but the rims looking Spike Lee
Mighty sloppy, might be cocky, am I in the right scene?
Highly unlikely, and I'm willing to fucking bet
Leave a pussy wet then I leave a pussy wet
I'm a fucking vet, I'm a motherfucking threat
G*59 the set, G*59 will make you sweat
"I don’t give a fuck" is my fucking epithet
Lace up my Nike Decades, meet me at Heaven's Gate
7th Ward by the lake 'til my death
[Outro]

I come through with helicopters
Beaucoup blades, and hella choppers
Looking like the dawn of Vietnam
Ruby crashin' on the lawn, who the fuck else dare to stop us?
Bitch, come through, blue veins turn into new stains
One of the original seven like Liu Kang
Slit the wrist of the six, no one left but me, bitch
The 7th Ward Lord got a new name
But Ruby does not exist due to a personality split
One-half devil, other half got zipped
Now, who the fuck else wanna talk shit?
Now, who the fuck else wanna get ripped?
Now, who the fuck else think I'm a bitch?
Come take a fucking sit
I swear to no god, you'll end up in a crypt
[Verse 2: YUNG CHRIST]
Snappin' like necks from that Bank on the west
Kurt Cobain veins, opium in my chest
Escaped out the psych ward, now I'm on a murder spree
Voices inside of me, won't let me go to sleep
Drownin' in sleeping pills, covered in ashes
Ridin' down Paris, this life never mattered
Ready to die, bitch, I'm ready to die
I pull on this trigger got blood on my satin
"Fuck, is he okay?" No, I'm just insane
Deranged out the gate, it's always been my fate
Lil $licky ride the pain, Ruby pumpin' shotty
Crucified in Tommy, Yung Christ risen out the concrete

[Outro: YUNG CHRIST]
$uicidal holocaust, for the dead, I shed a tear

Song title: Memoirs of a Gorilla

[Intro]
I am known

[Verse 1: Yung $carecrow]
Triple six serpents of death crawlin' under your skin
If I take a bet, you can guess who gon' win
I walk in the 'jects without no protection
I function in hoods every city I'm in
I'm that Grey-born gorilla out the concrete jungle
Duckin' from the dope 'cause I just shot a bundle
$carecrow make the chopper drum shots rumble
$carecrow got the dope game from my uncle
Huh, still prefer the drugs over bitches
Better watch your side that you pickin'
Snakes start hissin', heads go missing
Rest in piss to the ones I'm killing
Chief Keef drilling, codeine spilling
Blood on my linen from the cuts, never healing
Hot boys out the crypt with a mouth full of scripts
Body bags zip when the gun hammer click

[Verse 2: 7th Ward Dragon]
Ruby leveled up
Ruby leveled up
Ruby gon' global, epidemic proportion
I got the torch, and now I'm lighting up gas on the porch
Kick back, now I'm bored
$lick asked for the short, flick ash for the sport, uh
Ruby wrestles several devils in the 7th Ward
But Ruby can't afford to move towards the horde just yet
7th Ward Dragon with a fiery sword through the neck
Engulfed in flames, engulfed in blood
As it rains from the red heaven that Yung Plague has escaped
Levitate over Lake Pontchartrain
Set 'em straight, no, we are not the same
Yeah, it's hard to remain when you're self-slain
Yeah, it's all that remains when you're self-made
Ruby 'bout to take a second breath, uh
Embrace yourself, because all that remains is the bloodstains82EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
