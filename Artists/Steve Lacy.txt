Song title: Dark Red

[Verse 1]
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
I don't know what, but I feel it coming
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
I just hope she don't wanna leave me (Babe)

[Chorus]
Don't you give me up, please don't give up
On me, I belong, with you, and only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you

[Verse 2]
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
Why I feel this way I don't know maybe
I think of her so much it drives me crazy
I just don't want her to leave me (Babe)

[Chorus]
Don't you give me up, please don't give up
On me, I belong with you, and only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you
[Bridge]
What if she's fine?
It's my mind that's wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long
What if (If) she’s fine? (Fine)
It’s my mind that’s wrong
And I just (Just) let bad thoughts (Thoughts)
Linger for far too long

[Chorus]
Don't you give me up please don't give up
On me, I belong, with you, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you53EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Ryd

[Hook]
Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl I want you to ride with me
Baby ride on me
Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl I want you to ride with me
Baby ride on me

[Verse]
I see the way you lookin' at me
Through my peripheral
Vision pretty baby as I ride on this empty road
I'm just lookin' for somethin' to do
Asked if she was hungry does she want any food and
She said, "Nah" then she kissed me on my cheek
Next thing I know she was feelin' on me
And
I was in the M double-O D
When she said park my car down the backstreet

[Hook]
Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl I want you to ride with me
Baby ride on me
Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl I want you to ride with me
Baby ride on me30EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Some

[Hook]
Baby, I want some of your love
Your love, your love
Baby, can I have some of your love
Your love, your love

[Verse 1]
I know there's lots of love in your heart
But, who you gonna give it to?
Ohhh, I'm sure there's lots of guys that you see
But, I swear they are not as cool as me
Girl I can take you where you wanna go
If you wanna ride, we could watch a movie
Hit the beach, or just chill and get high
And we can do whatever you wanna do

[Hook]
Baby, I want some of your love
Your love, your love
Baby, can I have some of your love
Your love, your love

[Outro]
I just wanna take it
(Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Take it slow
Said I just wanna take it
(Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Take it slow, oh12EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

[Verse 1]
Meet me outside of my palace
Don't need no approval, girl, you valid
Let's make out right by my violets
Don't watch me do it, close your eyelids

Uh, hey baby
Um, I know I keep asking this
Um, but I guess I just really wanna know at this point
You know, we've been intimate for a while
Been crushing on each other for years
But I guess I'd just really like to know if
You feel the same way about me as I feel about you
You know all your feelings for me inside of your heart
Let me know, bye

Song title: Like me

[Part 1]

[Intro: Steve Lacy]
Hello
This is about me and what I am
I didn't wanna make it a big deal
But I did wanna make a song, I'll admit
Uh, I just wanna, just see who can relate, who's out there
You know, it's like, bro, um
I don't know if you can still relate
You know, and that's what I'm afraid of
I just wanna relate to everyone, so

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
How many out there just like me?
How many work on self-acceptance like me?
How many face a situation like me?
I wonder, oh
How many out there just like me?
How many others not gon' tell their family?
How many scared to lose their friends like me?
I wonder, I wonder

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
[Verse 1: Steve Lacy]
I only feel energy, I see no gender
When I talk 'bout fish, I wanna catch ya, I'm a fisher
Now they debate on who I like, they wanna see a list of
Girls and boys out here so they can see if I'm official
I tell 'em, ooh, come down, this ain't your life found
If you want to smile, if you're happy for me now
I hope you can relate, if you can't right now
You might be a little late or you might never get it down
But who like

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
How many out there just like me?
How many work on self-acceptance like me?
How many face a situation like me?
I wonder, oh
How many out there just like me?
How many others not gon' tell their family?
How many scared to lose their friends like me?
I wonder, I wonder

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really...
[Verse 2: Daisy]
Ah, I used to wanna be normal
I used to lay out the labels and pray that one of them stuck
I used to beat myself up, but it's too abstract to scratch past
So I ain't asking for an answer like that (No, no)
I'm over hoping for a box to check, a giant past to connect
I' argued with myself over breakfast, yeah
I scavenge my mind, but she rides in spirals counter to clockwise
I'll be your passenger (When you're too distracted to drive)
And I'll be your lover (If you think you're down for the ride)
Ain't got a preference, a wifey or a boyfriend
Or something in-between, we don't need no categories

[Chorus: Steve Lacy & Daisy]
How many out there just like me? How many out there?
How many work on self-acceptance like me?
How many face a situation like me?
I wonder, oh I wonder, I wonder
How many out there just like me? How many out there?
How many others not gon' tell their family?
How many scared to lose their friends like me?
I wonder, I wonder

[Post-Chorus: Steve Lacy]
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
I really wonder, wonder, I really, I wonder
[Part 2]

[Verse]
I cried to the window
No one heard my pain, just my window
Tears cried on my pillow
I'm in need of a flower, bring some willows
I cry in the window (Ah)
Uh huh (Ah)
[Part 3]

[Verse]
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
We'll all fade away
I fade away
I fade away
I fade away
I fade away

Song title: Playground

[Chorus]
Know you wanna play 'round
Well, baby, I'm on the playground
Hop on up, get on down
And wiggle that thing that's so round

[Verse 1]
Somethin' in the way you treat me like you do
Two can play the game when it feels so right next to you
And we can leave up out of here, bring your body here
Two can feel the same on nights where love is the plan

[Chorus]
Know you wanna play 'round
Well, baby, I'm on the playground
Hop on up, get on down
And wiggle that thing that's so round
Know you wanna play 'round
Well, baby, I'm on the playground
Hop on up, get on down
And wiggle that thing that's so round

[Verse 2]
Remember all the days you left me by the phone
You love to hesitate, now you are the second place
You must have saw me out holdin' hands with someone else
Baby blink without a doubt, I see the signs you keep givin' me
[Bridge]
Yeah, shake on, shake it down like what
Shake on, shake it down, that bridge
Shake on, shake it down like what
Shake on, shake it down, that bridge

[Outro]
Sometimes people say
We just run away
But we keep comin' back
To ya
Our mistakes
Make us great
We shine, you're gold
Know you wanna play 'round6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Only If

[Chorus]
If I could travel through time, I think I
Would tell myself from the past, "You'll be fine"

[Verse]
But what you don't know is the fun part of passion
And its the place where I think all the fun begins
What you don't see is what you believe
But to be is the place where the angels dance
What you don't hear is the voice of fear
When you get passed that is when your life appears
What you don't touch is what you won't clutch
But you'll latch on tight when the coast is clear

[Chorus]
If I could travel through time, I think I
Would tell myself from the past, "You'll be fine"2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Looks

[Hook]
I want you and you want me
But we don't know each other enough
To tell
Looks ain't enough
Looks ain't enough

[Verse 1]
I know you think you like
Me cause I'm the man
And I be lookin' good
But you gotta understand
That there's more to this
What if I got with you and turned out to be a total dick
Would you be happy 'bout that?
No...

[Hook]
I want you and you want me
But we don't know each other enough
To tell
Looks ain't enough
Looks ain't enough14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
