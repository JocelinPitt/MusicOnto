Song title: Who Want Smoke?? (Remix)

[Intro: Nardo Wick]
I'm wicked
I'm wicked
I'm wicked (EMKAY)
I'm wicked (EMKAY, EMKAY)

[Chorus: Nardo Wick]
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?

[Verse 1: Nardo Wick]
Who want smoke with me? I'm tryna fuck a nigga lungs up
They be like, "Nardo, put them damn guns up"
Fuck that, say, "Big brother, bring them guns out"
When it's smoke, we get to spinnin' while the sun out
I ain't never lackin', I pump gas with my gun out
Scream out, "What's happenin'?" Then get to bussin' 'til it run out
All these niggas hidin', I'm likе where they at? It ain't no fun now
7.62s big as hеll'll knock a nigga lungs out
One, two, three, four (Kick your door, get on the floor)
Five, six, seven, eight (Don't make no noise, I'll eat your face)
Nine, ten, eleven, we ain't gon' say that number, we don't fuck with jakes
I'ma kill fourteen niggas if thirteen bitch niggas play
I think my Draco might be gay (Why?), 'cause he blow niggas
I just got a brand new Lolli, that's a four-nickel
Call me Nardo yes-man, I don't know niggas
You can send your best man, you gon' lose your best hitter
[Refrain: Nardo Wick & Lil Durk]
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
That's how I step on niggas
(How I step on these bitch-ass niggas, yeah, man, what?)

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They be on my page like, "Slide for Von," I know they trollin' me (Cap)
Outside with y'all big homie, be on, I keep them folks with me (Bop)
Got it back in blood, y'all just don't know, that's how it 'posed to be (Shh)
Called him for a feature just to kill him 'cause we know he sweet (Grrah, grrah)
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, who the fuck is that?
Bro, go check the door, look out the window, don't forget the strap (Let's get it)
I be on they ass when I see opps, I do forget I rap (I do)
I be on this shit wherever I'm at, I learned that from the 'Raq
He gon' drink whatever a nigga sell him just to say he high
They be like, "He wasn't even with that shit," whenever a nigga die (He gone)
Emergency room gon' always lie to y'all whenever a nigga die (True)
Sayin' a nigga stable as they check, just to keep y'all quiet (Let's get it)
Bronem stomp his ass
Better do what Nardo said, 'cause niggas die for pumpin' gas (Boom)
Why you act like that shit so exclusive? Bitch, that's public ass (Public ass)
Can't no nigga we don't fuck with come around, we stomp his ass
Nardo voice, creep up out that cut, we like shh, shh
Nardo voice, catch him before he run, that gun go shh, shh (Grrah)
Ayy, who you killed? Steady talkin' like you did a drill (Gang)
We gon' kill you sober, who done told you that I need a pill? Gang
[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Real-deal stepper, put my toe on that boy
You Mickey Mouse, bitch, you went and told on that boy
All my guns come with a switch 'cause I'm fuckin' rich
I don't type no tweets or throw no fists, get shot in your shit
Old niggas steady tryna diss, fuck up off my dick
Caught him leaving bingo with his bitch and we sent a blitz
Nardo tryna fight me 'bout the stick, it's his turn to blick
I can't even roll my opps in shit, pussies don't exist
One, two, three, four niggas mad I fucked they ho
Five, six, seven, eight pussies that got hit with this K
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, don't got L's, they gotta chase
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen hollow tips, they hit his face

[Refrain: 21 Savage]
What the fuck is that? (What the fuck is that?)
What the fuck is that? (What the fuck is that?)
Hit that lil' bitch from the back (Fah, fah, fah, fah, fah, fah, fah)
Pest control, who called 'bout rats? (Pussy)

[Chorus: G Herbo]
Who want smoke with us?
Who want smoke with us?
Who want smoke with us? (Who want smoke with me?)
Who want smoke with us? (Who want smoke?)
Who want smoke with us? (Fuck nigga)
Who want smoke with us (Brr), nigga? (Ayy)
[Verse 4: G Herbo]
I be with real killers, I'm a rappin' street nigga (Street nigga)
Copy, paste, delete niggas (Ayy)
Can't wait 'til we see niggas (Okay)
Who want smoke? It's free (Smoke, it's free)
All the oppers sweet, Swisher
Hop out middle of the street, hit him (Hit him)
Soon as he fall off his feet, kill him
Been out all week
Seen three R.I.P. pictures
My shooters all eatin' (All of 'em)
You can tell that we richer
Pull up ballin', swish
Been on all the hits (All the hits)
Now I'm all legit (All legit)
Shout out Nardo Wick (That's lil' bro), bitch
One, two, three, four, fuck the opps, them niggas hoes
Five, six, seven, eight, slammin' rakes, we GDK
Nine, ten, 'leven, twelve, no mask, still ain't go to jail (Brr)
Hundred K checks in the mail
Put that away just for bail
All the crack we used to sell
Auntie house still got the smell
Fans be negative as hell
Fuck that shit, I just prevail
AR hold a hundred shells
Aim that bitch, shoot everywhere
No Limit, I never care
Spin they block, they never there (Pussy)

[Refrain: G Herbo]
What the fuck is that? (What the fuck is that?)

Turn his whip into a bastard
Take his life, he shouldn't have had it
I'm quick to snap just like my daddy
My nina rules, she kinda sassy
Let her go, she'll let you have it
Play you, lay you, try you down
I'm cold as hell, but I let off fire
Please don't try 'cause you gon' die
And I don't wanna see your mama cry

Song title: Shhh

[Intro]
Ayy, what he said?
Ayy (Onokey fully loaded), what he said?
What he said? (Mm, Emkay), what he said?
What he said?

[Chorus]
He said he a killer, he said he a gangster
He said he a robber, he said he got pounds
He said he shot what's his name, he said he the realest in it
Nardo what you got to say? Shh
I don't wanna talk, don't talk to me, niggas talk too much (Shh)
Don't come around talking about shit I did, I ain't saying nothing (Shh)
Niggas scared of eyes, all I did was look and he ran from me (Shh)
He had ran away, I tried to hit his back, hit his leg, nigga went to Double Dutching (Shh)

[Verse]
You know I don't talk a lot, nina, that's my translator
Claiming he was solid, heard life and turned to Fantasia
Them niggas don't never step, they much used to elevators
Metal stay with me, the steel apart of me like Terminator
Shh, shh, shh, shh, ha, ha, ha, ha
Up the glicky-Glock and it go frrah, frrah, frrah, frrah
Shh, shh, shh, shh, ha, ha, ha, ha
Tryna hit his heart and make it stop, stop
I don't know how niggas snitches, easy just to not talk
That nigga head ain't worth shit, it's easy just to get bought
I don't really like to spin, I'd rather use my feet and walk
I don't really sugar coat, I give it to you blood raw
I was fifteen with my gun in school, ask Reggie
I was fifteen out here robbing shit, ask Tony
If a nigga said Wick ain't real, then he don't know me
It's hot as hell, got a jacket on 'cause that bitch on me
[Chorus]
He said he a killer, he said he a gangster
He said he a robber, he said he got pounds
He said he shot what's his name, he said he the realest in it
Nardo what you got to say? Shh
I don't wanna talk, don't talk to me, niggas talk too much (Shh)
Don't come around talking about shit I did, I ain't saying nothing (Shh)
Niggas scared of eyes, all I did was look and he ran from me (Shh)
He had ran away, I tried to hit his back, hit his leg, nigga went to Double Dutching (Shh)

[Outro]
Me not wanna talk, me go mute
Me not wanna fight, me want shoot
Me not want new friends, me want loot
Me a animal, me belong to the zoo
I don't wanna talk, don't talk to me
I don't wanna talk, don't talk to me
I don't wanna talk, don't talk to me
I don't wanna talk, don't talk to me, no IG killers follow me
Shh, shh, shh, shh, ha, ha, ha, ha
Up the glicky-Glock and it go frrah, frrah, frrah, frrah

[Verse 1]
I'm a wicked nigga, he know, she know, everybody know
Ain't come in super deep, it's four of us, but everybody go
If I was to stop rappin' today, these niggas wouldn't know how to flow
If shootin' houses wasn't allowed, then these niggas wouldn't know how to scope
We the socks, his block the feet, let's pull up on him
We the pants, his block the leg, let's pull up on him
Wе Stephen Curry, his block the logo, lеt's pull up on him (Swerve on him)
Let's make a wish, his block the candle, pull up and blow him

[Bridge]
Grrah-grrah, I'm hot, diss me, face shots
Drive-bye, ah-ah, walk down, brrat-brrat
Before the switch, fire-fire, after switch, grrah (Wicked)
"You so wicked," haha, kill 'em all, right now

[Verse 2]
Pull up and empty cans, I'm the garbage man
Me and my niggas like The Beatles, we got hella fans
Ain't talkin' 'bout people, talkin' 'bout what you use to blow a man
Hella drums, ain't talkin' 'bout chicken or that shit you use to rock a band
Uh, uh, can't name a nigga fuckin' with me
Can't say you wicked, you ain't never pulled up bustin' with me
That chopper kickin', they ain't know I brought a punter with me
And that nina got extensions, they ain't know I brought the bundles with me
They say if you goin' that way, it's dangerous there, I'm dangerous too, let's take it there
You drop a diss, I bet you'll die, gon' head and do it, I double dare
You play, we overdo it, ain't gettin' even, we don't play it fair
Aim at his top and let it rip, I wanna see you burn his hair (Shot that nigga's head off)

[Verse 3]
Ain't got no ski mask, okay, use a shirt, won't fuck long, okay, pop a Perc'
Before I ever made a song, I had already robbed a clerk
Before I ever made a song, I hopped out, let that glizzy twerk
Before I ever made a song, I tried to put shit in the dirt
Uh-huh, uh, I made my first song, I was seventeen (On my mama)
That was two years after I started sellin' green (On my mama)
And that was the year after I sold fake lean (On my mama)
'Round the time I kept a hammer in my jeans (On my mama)
That was two years after I was tryna go on hits with Tony
Uh, hold on, hold on

Song title: Who Want Smoke?? (Remix 2)

[Intro: Nardo Wick]
I'm wicked
I'm wicked
I'm wicked (EMKAY)
I'm wicked (EMKAY, EMKAY)

[Chorus: Logisafe]
Who wan't dance like that?
Who wan't dance like that?
Who wan't dance like that?
I said "Who wan't dance like that?"
Who wan't dance like that?
Who wan't dance like that?
Who wan't dance like that?
I said "Who wan't dance like that?"

[Verse 1: Logisafe]
I'm nine years old, but have chains that are gold
Going outside, its cold, my chain is not sold
Let's get it Lil Wayne, why does Lil Wayne rhymes with the word rain
Travis Scott had a song with Lil Wayne
La Flame, The Box, The Box, The Race
Roddy Ricch is here, four hundred million views on a song
Onе, two, three, four (I was four in two thousand and fourteen)
Five, six, seven, еight (I was eight in two thousand and twenty)
Nine, ten, eleven, I'm gonna be eleven in one year
I can't disappear, what is with my ear, tell him that i'm here, cannot feel
I wan't when i'm fifteen that i remember to the time that i had no Racks
And feel like Jeff Bezos lowkey and say who's up next
I'm that person that wan't X, his text was had the best steps
HipHop is now so bad that i is not funny, I is only flexing with money
And that is what i mean so far, I'm looking to one star and then to our car
Playing Fortnite and find a scar, no, I'm gonna play something on my guitar
Me and my Family, we are normal people, so that is what we six are
I pray every day to Allah in the sky, no Matter what you thing but i wanna fly
[Refrain: Logisafe]
Why do you dance like that?
Why do you dance like that?
That's because you on Puberty
(You are on Puberty but i'm not on Puberty)

[Verse 2: Nardo Wick]
Who want smoke with me? I'm tryna fuck a nigga lungs up
They be like, "Nardo, put them damn guns up"
Fuck that, say, "Big brother, bring them guns out"
When it's smoke, we get to spinnin' while the sun out
I ain't never lackin', I pump gas with my gun out
Scream out, "What's happening?" then get to bussin' 'til it run out
All these niggas hidin', I'm like where they at? It ain't no fun now
7.62s, they big as hell, knock a nigga lungs out
One, two, three, four (Kick your door, get on the floor)
Five, six, seven, eight (Don't make no noise, I'll eat your face)
Nine, ten, eleven
We ain't gon' say that number, we don't fuck with jakes
I'ma kill fourteen niggas if thirteen bitch niggas play
I think my Draco might be gay (Why?)
'Cause he blowin' niggas
I just got a brand new Lolli
That's a four nickel
Call me Nardo, yes, man
I don't know niggas
