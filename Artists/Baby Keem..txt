Baby Keem, not a wave, I'm a vibe, ho
Seven fig nig with the big drip on me (Yeah)
Post on your block with your wish list on me

[Part I]

[Intro]
I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up the schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
How I'm 'posed to act when my morals ain't respected?
How you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
What's next? War and turbulence, prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same

[Verse 1]
Trademark on that pussy, trademarkin' my brand-new bitch
Yеah, duh, hol' up, blood, hol' up, cuh, hol' up, sis, huh (Hol' up)
LLC the Glock and I LLC my bitch, huh (LLC)
Pass me the rock, I go crazy on my kicks, huh
Had to tеll my grandma, "Sit back, relax" and shit, huh (Make nigga)
Make nigga buy her house and car, she's off the list, huh
Fake nigga, talkin' 'bout he rich but barely is, huh
Eight figures, jumpin' off the stage into the kids, huh (Yeah)
Single out the shooter, take the shooter to the blitz, huh (Yeah)
Droppin' out of school, dropped deposit on their crib, huh (Yeah)
Poppin' out on Instagram, I only post my bitch, huh
I don't need your input, get your two cents off my pic, huh
Generation money, type of money dyin' rich
And I wanna say, "Shoutout to the dead, now I flex," woah
[Chorus]
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (One)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you niggas not taking a risk
I'm taking advantage and taking my course (Kill 'em)
I cannot compete with the mud in my system
My tolerance low, I don't tolerate force
I protect, I am the one
I rose up for the score
I gotta let my ego go
You niggas not ready to settle the war (Yeah)
You niggas not ready to stop bein' hoes
You niggas not ready to open the doors
You niggas run in, take off with the drawer
You niggas not really the richest on Forbes
You niggas not ready to deal with the sacrifices
And instead, you're passin' the torch
And check the surveillance camera at the cemetery
See me dancin' on all of your corpse, go

[Segue]
You could only have love
Ooh, could I say it more?
Could I say it more?
[Part II]

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Ayy, E38
Got pulled over twice, had to go and switch plates
Bitch, don't think shit sweet
I'm the same Baby Keem in forty-eight states
I play charades with the bank
Just net ten million, now I'm back with the Wraith
And I'm goin' home with the loot
Mama goin' home with a coupe

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)
A hot girl

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I took the 'Lac then hopped on the flight
I cannot look towards your jaded advice
I took the torch, I quit being nice
I took the torch, now I gotta fight
You niggas impulsive, quick to make moves
You're biting your flows, a big appetite
I look at the hoes, they not at your shows
I look at your shows, they Oprah white
You gotta be nimble and quick like a fox
I don't move in silence, this shit is abrupt
I'm VVS-ed up, precise in the cut
Did she get a nut? It's not about me
As long as you good, don't worry 'bout me
I'm telling my friends that you not a freak
My new Nia Long is Kaepernick strong
And she not afraid to get on one knee
I'm back at the crib, my memory deep
I think about mama, I'm Baby Hykeem
She got that tatted before I could read
I'm spiritual now, I pray in my sleep
Twenty years long, I never had dad
My dad was a fraud, I had to be tough
Twenty million, ho, that's not enough
Don't ask no questions, bitch, go add it up
I took the light to sacrifice
I sacrificed everything I need
I could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep
Young nigga know the hustle and the Ps
Stressing 'bout money, turned to other things
I was in uncle crib at fourteen
Can't get through to mama 'cause she'd rather drink
Facin' eviction by the thirteenth
[Refrain: Baby Keem]
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)

[Verse 1]
I get the top while I skeet off (Huh)
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
For the ones down, I say, "Free y'all"
I start to question what freedom is
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say "Freeze, freeze"
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I stopped wearin' VVs
(Huh, huh, huh)
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic' (Huh)
Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
So what is the use of my dick?
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
Like she's entitled to it
I'm done, bitch, go to your room

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it
[Chorus]
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes

[Verse 2]
I need another exit at the show
'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
Y'all gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid
Even if I take a loss
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid (Huh, huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it

Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way

Song title: HONEST

[Pre-Chorus]
Half-past twelve I was all alone
I can't be compromised
Fuckin' on my ex, we ain't apologize
'Cause I'm way too young and you always right
Threw it in my face, I'm on another flight
Girl at home, I ain't been living right
The little arguments always start the fight
I had to get away so I'm with you tonight
Is there another guy?

[Chorus]
Be honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest
'Cause I'm honest

[Verse]
You're not who I love (Huh)
I just need to pass the time (Huh)
Felt good, you felt that
Come and get a peace of mind (Huh)
Move on, brands on me
Stripes in my pocket and a check on me
Never needed shit so don't you check on me
Home last night, the scent of sex on me
Baby Keem, shit, I'm chosen
I whip that red Toyota like it's stolen
I treat my lil' orange soda like a hellcat
She put me out in the winter, feet frozen
She wanna fuck with me 'cause I'm famous
And that's okay with me, 'cause you been my favorite
I let her do it, she do a lil' bit
A lil' air in her room, she do a lil' bit
[Pre-Chorus]
Half-past twelve I was all alone
I can't be compromised
Fuckin' on my ex, we ain't apologize
'Cause I'm way too young and you always right
Threw it in my face, I'm on another flight
Girl at home, I ain't been living right
The little arguments always start the fight
I had to get away so I'm with you tonight
Is there another guy?

[Chorus]
Be honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, are you honest?
'Cause I'm honest, honest, honest, let's be honest

Born into status, tell nobody that you never had it
Don't tell nobody that you was abandoned

I can't feel sorry, you're a lost ransom
Drown yourself in expensive fabrics
I think you picked up a lot of bad habits
Just appreciate yourself

Just grab my hand and look me in the eye
But this ain't something you should decide

I should have never sent that text, I will be honest
I'm sorry for the things I said, I will be honest

[Verse 1]
I've been duckin' my friends, I've been stuck on my ends
Memories about people all in my head
First come to mind is my mama buyin' me Jordans
Are we really made equal? 'Cause everybody got plans
I can't go ghost, I face demons
Don't let it defeat you, all in my hands
I know it's hard for you to come out that trance
I look myself in the mirror when I can
Let's speak the truth, tell me in pieces
I know it's you, I know just what you do
I knew since we first got evicted out our roof
My new since rehab, I was six, tryna see you

[Chorus]
How could I resent you? Demons, they test you
Grandma and I missed you
You don't know what we been through
Don't let the wolves come get you, ooh-ooh

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all question my exit?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all livin' on the fence?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why I'm sleepin' on it?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all get me so upset?
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why y'all want me dead?
Why y'all listen to the demons in your head?
Why do we play victim? Good times are ahead

Attention, this is my life sentence, huh, huh
You're committed, huh, defensive 'bout your vision, huh, huh
Don't you get offended, huh

Song title: ​scars

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, already livin' my truths
Can't sabotage my love for nothing
'Member I had to choose, "Lord, help me" 'cause I couldn't say nothin'
This remind me of them days before I was buzzin'
Whеn my auntie told me
"Come insidе the house, you make a mess, I'll kick you out"
Don't saturate my love for some respect, I cannot vouch
Judgin' from my shoes and all they seein' is the couch
My moral what I stand on so I got up and I bounced

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
[Verse 2]
(Mmm-mmm)
In the backseat, holdin' on for dear life, I must
(Mmm-mmm)
Runnin' them streets, thinkin' that I'll never get touched
(Mmm-mmm)
I've hit the point where enough is never enough, yeah
I gotta see my ceiling with those I trust (Ooh-ooh)
I'd rather feed my feelings with those I lust (Ooh-ooh)
You know what it means, I had low self-esteem
We was livin' on the east side
And I had to pack up my things when my mama was 'sleep
Two kisses to the peace sign
That's when life was on the decline
Two bus passes I'll be fine

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make tear us apart?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
[Bridge]
(Close your mind a little bit)
Can you blame us?
(Random thoughts in my head)
You can blame us
(Can't get the bad out my head)
Can you blame us?
(Is this from the pain I had)
Can you blame us? (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
I need a new fixation (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Open the conversations (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Starting to lose my patience (Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh)
Inviting new temptations

[Chorus]
I ask God (God)
Why this life you gave so hard?
Why all the choices that I make leave me with scars?
I feel like everyone I meet confuse my heart
