Hey little lady, I know you're feelin' crazy (Woo)

Song title: Stuck in the Middle

[Intro]
You know what she said to me?

[Verse 1]
She said, "You're a player, aren't you?
And I bet you got hoes"
I said, "You don't know me like that
I just go with the flow, oh, oh"
She said, "You can't fool me like that
You're gonna leave me on read"
I said, "Why don't you try me on out
I know you wanna be friends"

[Pre-Chorus]
But friends turn into sleepovers
And sleepovers turn into love
Love turns into jealousy
And now we both fucked up

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends
And we're losing every part of the benefits
You hurt me more than I ever knew
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you

[Verse 2]
She said, "Are we exclusive or not?" (Exclusive or not)
I said, "What do you wanna do?
Seems like you love me a lot" (Seems like you love me a lot)
She said, "Can we stop the joking
And take me seriously" (Take me seriously)
I said, "I'll try my very best
But we'll have to wait and see" (Let's wait and see)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause talks turn into sleepless nights
And sleepless nights turn into love (Turn into love)
Love turns into impatience
And now we both fucked up (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends (Lovers and friends)
And we're losing every part of the benefits (Losing benefits)
You hurt me more than I ever knew (Than I ever knew)
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you

[Bridge]
Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle with you (Hey, hey)
Stuck in the middle (Stuck in the middle)
Stuck in the middle with you-ou-ou (Hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Because fights turn into making up
And making up turns into love (Turns into love)
Love turns into forever (Forever)
And that scares both of us (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends (Lovers and friends)
And we're losing every part of the benefits (Hey, hey)
You hurt me more than I ever knew
But it's shitty 'cause I'm doing the same to you8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: DRUGS

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna tell my mom I smoke this weed
I don't wanna tell my dad, he'll call me weak
I don't wanna be the blackest of the sheep
Missing their call every single week
I don't wanna say

[Chorus]
Sometimes I do drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Drugs
Can't find us, if you think I'm gone
I'm just doing drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Don't mind me if I light up
Only need it sorta kinda
Drugs
La da da da da, la da da da da
Drugs
La da da da da, la da da da da

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I don't care, sometimes I cry too
Sometimes life's a little hard to get used to
Occasionally, I forget to sleep
Remind myself that I gotta eat three times a day this week
Try not to clench my teeth
Got a little OCD
Listen to the CDC, when I'm feeling uneasy
[Chorus]
Sometimes I do drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Drugs
Can't find us, if you think I'm gone
I'm just doing drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Don't mind me if I light up
Only need it sorta kinda
Drugs
La da da da da, la da da da da
Drugs
La da da da da

[Chorus]
Sometimes I do drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Drugs
Can't find us, if you think I'm gone
I'm just doing drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up
Don't mind me if I light up
Only need it sorta kinda

[Chorus]
Sometimes I do drugs
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up (just change my mind up)
Drugs
Can't find us, if you think I'm gone
I'm just doing drugs (I’m just doing drugs)
Not hard ones, just ones that change my mind up (just change my mind up)
Don't mind me if I light up
Only need it sorta kinda (Ooh)
[Outro]

Song title: FEELING THIS BAD NEVER FELT SO GREAT

[Intro]
Feeling this bad never felt so great

[Verse 1]
She either slept with fifty people, or she's takin' a break
She's either tellin' people that she love me or she fillin' herself up with hate
She either out with the girls, at the club shakin' her ass
Or she's at home, listenin' to Adele, gettin' over me fast

[Chorus]
Feeling this bad never felt so grеat
Never thought that I'd be happy today
Now that you'rе gone and out of my way
Feeling this bad never felt so great

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Feeling this bad never felt so great
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Feeling this bad never felt so

[Verse 2]
I miss the sex, I miss the kiss on the neck
I miss gettin' triple texts, uh
Netflix askin' what we're watchin' next
Lovin' you 'til your muscles flex
I miss the spark, I miss you showin' me all of your art
Either we go together or we'll fall apart
Every day is hard
But I get through it
Doin' laundry listenin' to music
You got my hoodie but you can use it
I got six more and they keep me warm just fine
I'm learnin' to be with just me
Up in my head, it gets scary
Haven't called you back in weeks
But this is the first time I'm carefree
[Chorus]
Feeling this bad never felt so great
Never thought that I'd be happy today
Now that you're gone and out of my way
Feeling this bad never felt so great

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Feeling this bad never felt so great
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Feeling this bad never felt so

[Bridge]
Ever since I left you, I became a new man
I don't need to slow dance, I can hold my own hand
It's so hard to let go, we can still be friends though
It's so hard to let go, we can still be friends though

[Chorus]
Feeling this bad never felt so great (So great)
Never thought that I'd be happy today (Today)
Now that you're gone and out of my way (Out of my way)
Feeling this bad never felt so great

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh (So great), ooh, ooh-ooh (So great)
Feeling this bad never felt so great (So great)
Ooh-ooh (So great), ooh, ooh-ooh
Feeling this bad never felt so great1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: BAD BAD News

[Intro]
I've got some bad, bad news
I can't get over you
I tried 'til my face turned blue
Baby, you've got me held down by a string

[Verse 1]
'Cause you're the only one I see my future with
Buy a happy home and have at least two kids
Stay together longer than my parents did
Is that a stupid wish?

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to give you a little time
Try to give you a little space
But blastin' off into space
Is takin' up all of my breath away
Do you love somebody else or not?
I need the answer quick
The water is runnin' too cold
Under the bridge to go swimmin' in, mmm

[Chorus]
Don't act like you don't feel it too
Don't act like you don't like this bad, bad news
I don't care if I live my whole life confused
I'll be clueless with you
My God, I hate to tell you
All of this bad, bad news
I don't know what to do
But be clueless with you, oh
[Verse 2]
There you go callin' me again past midnight
We've had our battles, brawls, and fights
But we made it through World War III
And I just want you here with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to give you a little time
Try to give you a little space
But blastin' off into space
Is takin' up all of my breath away
Do you love somebody else or not?
I need the answer quick
The water is runnin' too cold
Under the bridge to go swimmin' in, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't act like you don't feel it too
Don't act like you don't like this bad, bad news
I don't care if I live my whole life confused
I'll be clueless with you
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be clueless
Clueless with you
My God, I hate to tell you
All this bad, bad news2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: ​i deserve 2 b alone

[Verse 1]
Wish we could stay eighteen
Get a little too high, stay in bed and daydream
I wish I could fix things
If I took it all back, would you come over?
Take me to your studio apartment
Kissin' in the darkness, stay in when my roommates were home
But I used your good graces, show my two faces
I deserve to end up alone

[Chorus]
Don't want you to take me back
Don't want you to call my phone
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone
Wasted too much of your time
Time that you'll never get back
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone

[Verse 2]
My heart's got a dead leg
Don't know if my blood cells blue or my blood cells red
Suggest a better way to save a memory that's halfway out of my head
I think the spark is dead (Is dead)
I think your bruise has scarred (It's scarred)
I never wanna be back with you, fightin' in the car so hard the alarm goes off
Don't mind my cough, just allergic to the bullshit
That I didn't admit spewin' up our relationship, just gave me two slaps on the wrist
You got the stick but the short end (Short end)
I hope you never lose your best friend (Best friend)
That's just me though, maybe you don't need to keep my two cents
[Chorus]
Don't want you to take me back (Oh-oh)
Don't want you to call my phone (Oh-oh)
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone
Wasted too much of your time (Oh-oh)
Time that you'll never get back (Oh-oh)
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone

[Bridge]
Was it all a bad dream?
The weed's all gone and now you're drinkin' caffeine
Up in your new address
The good parts are the only thing I kept

[Chorus]
Don't want you to take me back (Oh-oh)
Don't want you to call my phone (Oh-oh, don't call my phone)
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wasted too much of your time (Oh-oh)
Time that you'll never get back (Oh-oh, never get back)
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Outro]
My heart's got a dead leg (Oh-oh)
Don't know if my blood cells blue (Oh-oh) or my blood cells red (Oh-oh)
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone (Don't, no-no)
My heart's got a dead leg (Oh-oh)
Don't know if my blood cells blue (Oh-oh) or my blood cells red (Oh-oh)
You deserve to be loved, I deserve to be alone (Deserve to be alone)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Solamente

[Chorus]
I'm just out here solamente, pretty dizzy
From the world spinnin' faster than it should be
I'm just out here solamente, solo dolo
Paranoia follows me wherever I go

[Verse 1]
Maybe I quit too much
Baby, I'm just a little sick, so what?
Got a lotta bread, can't stand the crust
All of my plans  went boom then bust
I've turned into dust
Can't seem to find a single person that I can trust

[Chorus]
I'm just out here solamente, pretty dizzy
From the world spinnin' faster than it should be
I'm just out here solamente, solo dolo
Paranoia follows me wherever I go

[Post-Chorus]
Sola, sola, sola, solamente
Sola, sola, sola, solamente (Solamente)
Sola, sola, solamente
Sola, sola, solamente (Okay)
[Verse 2]
Okay, Mrs. Counsellor, you seem to be countin' up
Reasons why my backbone so soft, no vertebra
Then I went vertical (Vertical)
All of my accomplishments, just went virtual (Virtual)
Google me, you bitch, my name so searchable
Go ask G's, big on Yelp, five stars please, awards on shelves
Every time I say "I'm good", do I mean well?
Helping every other person, except for myself

[Chorus]
I'm just out here solamente, pretty dizzy
From the world spinnin' faster than it should be
I'm just out here solamente, solo dolo
Paranoia follows me wherever I go

[Post-Chorus]
Sola, sola, sola, solamente (Solamente)
Sola, sola, sola, solamente (Solamente)
Sola, sola, solamente (Solamente)
Sola, sola, solamente (Yeah)

Song title: ​rEaL WOrLD

[Verse 1]
I haven't been the same since graduation
All my friends went but I didn't make it
They got that first-class ticket but I'm in coach
Feels like they threw me overboard, but my shit floats
I don't need a motherfuckin' plane, I'll take my boat
And I don't give a goddamn if my socks get soaked, uh

[Verse 2]
'Cause I never thought the same way as everybody else
But it still hurts, gettin' left out
Even if it's for a stupid piece of paper
That I don't give two shits about (About, about)

[Verse 3]
That school's not cool but I'm still cracked out on phonics
When I left that place, I was shakin' all the plate tectonics
Switch a 9 to 5 with sweet harmonics
I'm only takin' really, really positive, constructive comments
'Cause now I'm sensitive as fuck
Bitch

[Verse 4]
Feels like I was left out of the party
Thanks for the invite, I could hear the music all night
But when I come through, it's only whispers
I don't know what's worse, feeling love then hurt
All my friends got worse but I just blame the distance
They were too busy anyways, I would've done the same shit
[Verse 5]
Found out the real world, doesn't care 'bout nothin'
It shoots you in both knees, then says, "Start runnin'", ooh, ooh
Grab your pitchfork and grab your gun
The revolution has just begun
You're just a number to serve our funds
And when you keel over, you can be done
Nobody sees my dreams but me, but I'm cookin' a fantasy
All the ingredients are here, just be a little patient with me

[Outro]
I will never ever, fuckin' ever give up
Ever, that's itEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

Song title: Something to Cry About

[Verse 1]
I kinda like it when we fight
But that's a secret that I save just for myself
'Cause the corners of your eyes
Look so cute to me when you get mad as hell

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late now, baby (Too late, too late now)
I told you I was troubled from the start
My master plan's in motion (Don't know, no going back)
Now watch me as I slowly fall apart
First my brain, then my pride
I'm pushing them all aside
I'm an open book to read
I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Why don't you give me something to cry about
Maybe let my emotions out
My therapist would be so proud of me
Oh, I'm not writing all of my feelings down
When you read 'em, just sound them out
I'm loving you so unhealthily

[Verse 2]
I'm taking two sessions a week
She's giving me all of the things I need
Giving me strategies
I try not to fall asleep
But every night you keep me from counting sheep (Baby just let me sleep)
[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late now, baby (Too late, too late now)
I told you I was troubled from the start (From the start)
My master plan's in motion (Don't know, no going back)
Now watch me as I slowly fall apart (Fall apart)
First my brain, then my pride (My pride)
I'm pushing them all aside
I'm an open book to read
I'm on my knees (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Why don't you give me something to cry about
Maybe let my emotions out
My therapist would be so proud of me
Oh, I'm not noting my feelings down
When you read 'em, just sound them out
I'm loving you so unhealthily

[Breakdown]
I want to weep, I want the pain, I want the grief
I want my tear ducts to be deserts right after you're done with me
I told you baby, I want everything

[Chorus]
Why don't you give me something to cry about
Maybe let my emotions out
My therapist would be so proud of me (Hey!)
Woah, I'm not noting my feelings down
When you read 'em, just sound them out
I'm addicted to loving you unhealthily (Hey! Hey!)
Oh, so unhealthily
Loving you so unhealthily
Baby, why can't you see (Oh, oh, oh)2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
